    "###### How electron donation and withdrawal change chemical shifts  \\nWe can get an idea of the effect of electron distribution by looking at a series of benzene rings\\nwith the same substituent in the 1 and 4 positions. This pattern makes all four hydrogens on\\nthe ring identical. Here are a few compounds listed in order of chemical shift: largest shift\\n(lowest fi eld; most deshielded) fi rst. Conjugation is shown by the usual curly arrows, and\\ninductive effects by a straight arrow by the side of the group. Only one hydrogen atom and\\none set of arrows are shown.  \\nConjugation, as discussed in\\nChapter 7, is felt through π bonds,\\nwhile inductive effects are the\\nresult of electron withdrawal or\\ndonation felt simply by polarization\\nof the σ bonds of the molecule.\\nSee p. 135.  \\nthe effect of electron-withdrawing groups\\nby conjugation  \\nby inductive effects  \\n**H**  \\n**O**  \\n**O**  \\n**HO**  \\n**N**  \\nδH 8.48 δH 8.10 **C** δH 8.10 δH 8.07 δH 7.78  \\n**N**  \\n**O**  \\n**O**  \\n**OH**  \\n**C**  \\n**N**  \\n**O**  \\n**H**  \\n**F** **F**  \\n**F**  \\nThe largest shifts come from groups that withdraw electrons by conjugation. Nitro is the\\nmost powerful—this should not surprise you as we saw the same in non-aromatic compounds\\nin both [13]C and [1]H NMR spectra. Then come the carbonyl and nitrile group followed by groups\\nshowing simple inductive withdrawal. CF3 is an important example of this kind of group—\\nthree fl uorine atoms combine to exert a powerful effect.  \\n-----  \\nIn the middle of our sequence, around the position of benzene itself at 7.27 ppm, come\\nthe halogens, whose inductive electron withdrawal and lone pair donation are nearly\\nbalanced.  \\nbalance between withdrawal by inductive effect and donation of lone pairs by conjugation  \\n**I** δH 7.40 **Br** δH 7.32 δH 7.27 **Cl** δH 7.24 **F** δH 7.00  \\n**I**  \\n**Br**  \\n**Cl**  \\n**F**  \\nAlkyl groups are weak inductive donators, but the groups which give the most shielding—\\nperhaps surprisingly—are those containing the electronegative atoms O and N. Despite being\\ninductively electron withdrawing (the C–O and C–N σ bonds are polarized with δ + C), on\\nbalance conjugation of their lone pairs with the ring (as you saw on p. 278) makes them net\\nelectron donors. They increase the shielding at the ring hydrogens. Amino groups are the best.\\nNote that one nitrogen-based functional group (NO2) is the best electron withdrawer while\\nanother (NH2) is the best electron donor.  \\nthe effect of electron-donating groups  \\nby inductive effect  \\nbalance between withdrawal by inductive effect and donation\\nof lone pairs by conjugation—electron donation wins  \\n**H**  \\nδH 7.03  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\n**CH3**  \\nδH 6.80 **O**  \\n**H** **H**  \\nδH 6.59 **N**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 6.35  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\n**CH3**  \\n**O**  \\n**CH3**  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\n**N**  \\n**O**  \\nδH 7.27  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 7.27  \\nδH 5.68  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 5.68  \\n**O**  \\nδH 6.0  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 7.0  \\nδH 4.65  \\n**H**  \\n**H**  \\nδH 6.35  \\nAs far as the donors with lone pairs are concerned (the halogens plus O and N), two factors\\nare important—the size of the lone pairs and the electronegativity of the element. If we look\\nat the four halides at the top of this page the lone pairs are in 2p (F), 3p (Cl), 4p (Br), and 5p (I)\\norbitals. In all cases the orbitals on the benzene ring are 2p so the fl uorine orbital is of the\\nright size to interact well and the others too large. Even though fl uorine is the most electronegative, it is still the best donor. The others don’t pull so much electron density away, but\\nthey can’t give so much back either.\\nIf we compare the fi rst row of the p block elements—F, OH, and NH2—all have lone pairs\\nin 2p orbitals so now electronegativity is the only variable. As you would expect, the most\\nelectronegative element, F, is now the weakest donor.\n",

      "Although biofuels are appealing replacements for fossil fuels, their wide.  spread adoption has several potentiai drawbacks. One major concern is the food-versus-fuel issue. Typical plants used for food (e.g., sugarcane) are sources of biofuels, which drives up the cost of food. A positive aspect of biofu- els is that they are carbon neutral; that is, the $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\\mathrm{g})$ produced by the burning of a biofuel is then used by plants for new growth, resulting in no net gain of carbon in the atmosphere. Biofuels and their use have many other advantages and disadvantages. Importantly, chemical knowledge of these compounds is needed to address these issues. \n",

      "$\\mathbf{CCl}_{4}$ . Carbon tetrachloride molecules are nonpolar. Based on the elec- tronegativity difference between Cl and C, we expect a bond dipole for the C—Cl bond. The fact that the resultant dipole moment is zero means that  the bond dipoles must be oriented in such a way that they cancel. The tetra- hedral molecular geometry of $\\mathrm{CCl_{4}}$ provides the symmetrical distribution of bond dipoles that leads to this cancellation, as shown in Figure 10-16(a).  Can you see that the molecule will be polar if one of the Cl atoms is  replaced by an atom with a different electronegativity, say H? In the mole- cule, $\\mathrm{CH}_{3},$ there is a resultant dipole moment (Fig. 10-16b). \n",

      "  - Consolidate similar entities to avoid redundancy, ensuring each represents a distinct concept at appropriate granularity levels.\n",

      "2. Identify Data Properties:\n",
      "  - Extract attributes or characteristics of the identified entities that can be classified as data properties, ensuring they are value-based and not entities themselves.\n",
      "  - Clearly define each data property, ensuring it accurately describes an attribute of an entity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Establish Object Properties:\n",
      "  - Carefully examine the text to identify all relationships between entities, ensuring each relationship is correctly captured with accurate details about the interactions.\n",
      "  - Analyze the context and interactions between the identified entities to determine how they are interconnected, focusing on actions, associations, dependencies, or similarities.\n",
      "  - Clearly define the relationships, ensuring accurate directionality that reflects the logical or functional dependencies among entities.\n",

    "###### How electron donation and withdrawal change chemical shifts  \\nWe can get an idea of the effect of electron distribution by looking at a series of benzene rings\\nwith the same substituent in the 1 and 4 positions. This pattern makes all four hydrogens on\\nthe ring identical. Here are a few compounds listed in order of chemical shift: largest shift\\n(lowest fi eld; most deshielded) fi rst. Conjugation is shown by the usual curly arrows, and\\ninductive effects by a straight arrow by the side of the group. Only one hydrogen atom and\\none set of arrows are shown. \n",
    "\"\"\",\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\\nConjugation, as discussed in\\nChapter 7, is felt through π bonds,\\nwhile inductive effects are the\\nresult of electron withdrawal or\\ndonation felt simply by polarization\\nof the σ bonds of the molecule.\\nSee p. 135.  \\nthe effect of electron-withdrawing groups\\nby conjugation  \\nby inductive effects  \\n**H**  \\n**O**  \\n**O**  \\n**HO**  \\n**N**  \\nδH 8.48 δH 8.10 **C** δH 8.10 δH 8.07 δH 7.78  \\n**N**  \\n**O**  \\n**O**  \\n**OH**  \\n**C**  \\n**N**  \\n**O**  \\n**H**  \\n**F** **F**  \\n**F**  \\nThe largest shifts come from groups that withdraw electrons by conjugation. \n",
    "\"\"\",\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Nitro is the\\nmost powerful—this should not surprise you as we saw the same in non-aromatic compounds\\nin both [13]C and [1]H NMR spectra. Then come the carbonyl and nitrile group followed by groups\\nshowing simple inductive withdrawal. CF3 is an important example of this kind of group—\\nthree fl uorine atoms combine to exert a powerful effect.  \\n-----  \\nIn the middle of our sequence, around the position of benzene itself at 7.27 ppm, come\\nthe halogens, whose inductive electron withdrawal and lone pair donation are nearly\\nbalanced.  \\nbalance between withdrawal by inductive effect and donation of lone pairs by conjugation  \\n**I** δH 7.40 **Br** δH 7.32 δH 7.27 **Cl** δH 7.24 **F** δH 7.00  \\n**I**  \\n**Br**  \\n**Cl**  \\n**F**  \n",
    "\"\"\",\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\\nAlkyl groups are weak inductive donators, but the groups which give the most shielding—\\nperhaps surprisingly—are those containing the electronegative atoms O and N. Despite being\\ninductively electron withdrawing (the C–O and C–N σ bonds are polarized with δ + C), on\\nbalance conjugation of their lone pairs with the ring (as you saw on p. 278) makes them net\\nelectron donors. They increase the shielding at the ring hydrogens. \n",

    "If we look\\nat the four halides at the top of this page the lone pairs are in 2p (F), 3p (Cl), 4p (Br), and 5p (I)\\norbitals. In all cases the orbitals on the benzene ring are 2p so the fl uorine orbital is of the\\nright size to interact well and the others too large. Even though fl uorine is the most electronegative, it is still the best donor. The others don’t pull so much electron density away, but\\nthey can’t give so much back either.\\nIf we compare the fi rst row of the p block elements—F, OH, and NH2—all have lone pairs\\nin 2p orbitals so now electronegativity is the only variable.

      "Object Property: The ontology does not capture all key chemical interactions, as it omits object properties for other electron-withdrawing groups like carbonyl, nitrile, and CF3. To improve, additional object properties should be added to represent these interactions, ensuring a more comprehensive representation of chemical shifts.\n",
      "Ontology Structure: The ontology does not fully span all levels of chemical granularity mentioned in the text, particularly regarding the detailed interactions of lone pairs and specific inductive/conjugative effects. Additionally, while the ontology forms a coherent knowledge graph, it could benefit from more explicit relationships to capture the balance between different electron effects. Improvements could include adding entities or properties to represent these nuanced interactions and effects.\n",
      "Overall Content: The ontology could be improved by including more detailed information on the interactions and effects of different substituents on chemical shifts, particularly the role of lone pairs and the balance between inductive and conjugative effects.\n",
