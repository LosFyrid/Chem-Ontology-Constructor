 The kinetics of the decarboxylation of 6 - NBIC has also been examined in liposome 
dispersions  83   and in spontaneously formed catanionic vesicles.  90 For equimolar mixtures 
of  n  - cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium  n - heptyl sulfate,  k ves 
(8.29  ×  10  − 4  s  − 1 ) is higher than that in pure CTAB ( k ves  =  6.76  ×  10  − 4  s  − 1 ). Part of this rate 
increase may be due to the large concentration of NaBr in the solution. 
 Cationic vesicles, for example those formed from di -  n - hexadecyldimethylammonium 
bromide (DHAB) accelerate the decarboxylation by a factor of about 1000 relative to 
pure water.  91   Dehydration of the carboxylate group at the binding sites is most likely the 
main factor behind the catalysis. Different isokinetic temperatures (obtained from linear 
plots of enthalpies  vs . entropies of activation) have been observed above and below the 
main phase transition temperature. These excellent isokinetic relationships indicate that 
the catalytic effects are caused by a single important interaction mechanism. 92 
 From the view point of encapsulation, the effects of additives on the nature of vesicular 
binding sites are of special interest. An important additive is, of course, cholesterol, 
that plays an important role in life processes. It exerts important effects on the biophysi-
cal properties of biomembranes including their ﬂ uidity and the formation of microdo-
mains but also on membrane proteins, thereby regulating their functions. Interestingly, 
there is compelling evidence that phospholipid bilayer systems can form distinct 
cholesterol - rich and cholesterol - poor domains. 93   Extensive differential scanning micro-
calorimetric studies on vesicles formed from both synthetic amphiphiles and phospholi-
pids have shown signiﬁ cant effects of cholesterol on the main phase transition 
temperature, governed by changes in bilayer packing.  94   Compensating enthalpy and 
entropy effects on melting were found and cholesterol also inﬂ uences the cooperativity 
of bilayer melting. 
 Coming back to the decarboxylation of 6 - NBIC, cholesterol was found to reduce  k ves 
for DHAB vesicles by a factor of 3 when at 50   mol % in the bilayer. As a result of its 
appreciable hydrophobic surface area, it penetrates signiﬁ cantly into the bilayer, thereby 
decreasing the inter - amphiphile interactions. Under these conditions, the hydration of the 
interface is increased, and the reactant is stabilized. On the other hand, for trehalose as 
the additive, the value of  k ves  is slightly increased. This is in accord with the notion that 
binding to the bilayer surface leads to replacement of water molecules from the vesicular 
interface with a concomitant destabilization of bound 6 - NBIC.

 16.2.2  The Kemp Elimination: Rate - limiting Proton Transfer 
 A bimolecular reaction, with a substrate that is structurally related, albeit uncharged, and 
rather similar to the one examined in the previous paragraph, is the Kemp elimination. It 
involves the rate determining hydroxide - ion induced deprotonation of 5 - nitrobenzisoxa-
zole (5 - NBI,  1 , Figure  16.5 ). The high solvent sensitivity of this reaction primarily 
depends on the reactivity of the OH  −  ion. 95   The more weakly the hydroxide ion is solvated, 
particularly in apolar, aprotic solvents, the stronger the base catalysis. For example, the 
bimolecular rate constant ( k 2 ) is even 457 times higher in ethanol than in water. In cationic 
micelles (such as formed from  n - C 12 PyrI, DTAB, CTAB, CTACl and OTACl) the organic 
substrate will bind close to the aqueous interface, participating in both hydrogen bonding 
and hydrophobic interactions.  96   But what are exactly the properties of this interfacial 
region as a reaction environment? Indeed,  k 2  is also about 400 times higher than in water, 
in accord with the about similar dielectric constants of ethanol and of the Stern region of 
the micelles. Plots of  k obs  vs . the surfactant concentration show the typical biphasic pattern 
for a bimolecular reaction with both substrates partitioning between the bulk aqueous and 
micellar pseudophase. Hydroxide - ion binding to the micelles depends on the ability of 
the hydroxide ion to replace the counterion of the cationic micelles. 
 A kinetic study was also performed in a variety of vesicular solutions (DDAB, DODAB, 
DODAC; [NaOH]  =  2.25  mM, 25  ° C). 96   Interestingly, the vesicles possess stronger cata-
lytic reaction environments than the micelles.  97 The rate - determining proton transfer from 
carbon to the hydroxide ion was accelerated up to 850 fold in di -  n - dodecyldimethylam-
monium bromide (DDAB) vesicles. This is evidence that the reaction sides are less 
aqueous than those in micelles, as anticipated. Application of the pseudophase model 
afforded the bimolecular rate constants in the vesicles ( k ves ). For the different vesicles, 
 k ves is signiﬁ cantly higher ( ca . 12 times for DODAB) than the second - order rate constant 
in water. This shows that the catalysis is due to both a medium effect and a concentration 
effect. It was assumed that there was a fast equilibrium for substrate binding to the inner 
and outer leaﬂ ets of the bilayer, in accord with the fact that no two - phase kinetics were 
found. 
 Vesicle catalysis followed the order DDAB    >  DODAC  >  DODAB, with  k max / k w values 
of about 850, 550, and 160, respectively. This looked an unexpected result because the 
rate constants did not respond in the usual way to an increasing chain length of the tails. 
But it was recognized that the high catalytic efﬁ ciency of DDAB with the shortest alkyl 
chains was the result of vesicles being in the liquid - crystalline state at the reaction

Molecular Encapsulation
temperature while the other bilayers were in the gel state. A similar effect has been 
observed before  98 . 
 Addition of cholesterol leads to two counteracting effects on the rate constants. The 
ﬁ rst is a smaller counterion binding, reducing the rate constants. The other is a rate 
enhancing effect resulting from the less polar vesicular binding sides. The overall effect 
depends on the exact reaction conditions.  96 
 In a further detailed study the effects of several added long - tailed alcohols and  n - alkyl 
pyranosides were examined.  99   The overall results showed that minor structural changes 
in the additive and concentration of the additive exerted signiﬁ cant changes in the proper-
ties of the interfacial region and it was suggested that similar effects can be anticipated 
for the much more complex biological cell membranes. 
 Perhaps most interesting was the kinetic response upon addition of  n - dodecyl -  β -
 glucoside (C 12 Glu) and  n - dodecyl - β - maltoside (C 12 Mal). For C 12 Glu a rate increase was 
found, largely due to an increase of  k ves  since substrate binding (K s ) shows only a minor 
increase. Using a number of spectroscopic probes, the normalized polarity of the interfa-
cial region was estimated and the data indicated only a minor difference with bulk water.  99 
All evidence pointed to a partial dehydration of the interfacial reaction sites induced by 
C 12 Glu and a concomitant dehydration of the OH  −   ion. Therefore this effect was taken as 
the origin of the kinetic effects. 
 Addition of sodium di -  n  - decyl phosphate (DDP) to DODAB vesicles leads to the for-
mation of catanionic vesicles and rather drastic changes in the propertes of the interfacial 
region. Again the Kemp elimination was employed to probe these changes, in combina-
tion with cryo - electron microscopy, DSC, and measurements of the surface charge density 
and zeta - potentials. 97 Binding site polarties were assessed using Reichardt ’ s E T - 30 probe 
and pyrene. 
 Whereas for di - n  - octadecyldimethylammonium chloride (DODAB) vesicles  k ves is 
about 65 times larger than the water rate constant, addition of DDP decreases the vesicular 
catalysis. Experiments with the polarity probes indicated that the polarity of the bilayer 
surface hardly responded to addition of DDP and also the binding constant of 5 - NBI was 
not affected. It was argued that the reduction of the catalytic effect was due to a decrease 
in counterion binding resulting from addition of DDP. 97 Catalysis could be turned into 
rate inhibition as was observed for negatively charged vesicles containing 70   mol% DDP 
in the bilayer. Interestingly, DSC experiments revealed the presence of neutral microdo-
mains ( ‘ rafts ’ ) in case of 5 and 30  mol % DDP in the bilayer. 
 16.2.3  Bimolecular Nucleophilic Substitution 
 Another bimolecular single - step organic reaction which can be used to probe binding sites 
in vesicular aggregates is the S N 2 reaction of a series of aromatic alkylsulfonates (MNBS; 
AlkONs, Alk  =  Me, Et,  n - Pr,  n - Hex) with water (Figure  16.6 ). 100   Now the water is a 
nucleophile instead of a hydration agent as in the previous probe reactions. 
 The rates of these hydrolysis reactions (Nu   =   H 2 O) can be compared with nucleophilic 
substitution by bromide ions (Nu  =  Br  −  ). A kinetic study has been made of these reac-
tions in the presence of vesicles formed from synthetic amphiphiles, phospholipids, and 
mixtures of both types of amphiphiles.  100   Particular attention was paid to the effect of 
addition of  n - dodecyl -  β - glucoside (C 12 Glu) as a mimic for glycolipids. Kinetic data were

analyzed using the pseudo - phase model to afford rate constants for the S N - 2 process in 
the aqueous phase and in the vesicular pseudo - phase. The experimental data can be 
reconciled with the reactions occurring at the vesicle – water interphase, with the nature 
of the binding sites being modiﬁ ed by the presence of C 12 Glu. It was calculated that for 
vesicles containing 50   mol% of C 12 Glu, the vesicular surface is covered for about 34% 
by C 12 Glu. 
 Rate constants for the reactions in the presence of overall positively charged vesicles 
are about ten times larger than those in the absence of vesicles. The effect was ascribed 
to an increase in the reactivity of water. In case the water molecules at the vesicular 
interphase are in part replaced by the glucose groups of C 12 Glu, the catalytic efﬁ ciency 
of the vesicles decreases signiﬁ cantly. 
 The bimolecular rate constants for the reaction with bromide ions are smaller at the 
vesicular interphase, and independent of the presence of C 12 Glu. These results indicate 
that this reaction, not involving water as a reactant, is not sensitive towards partial dehy-
dration of the binding sites of the organic substrate.   
 16.3  Liposomal Encapsulation in Drug Delivery 
 Since the discovery of liposomal vesicles  9   it has been envisioned that the closed inner 
compartment of a vesicle can be used to trap potentially harmful substances or to protect 
unstable compounds from decomposition by shielding them from the outside.  101,102 Despite 
the high potential of liposomal formulations in drug delivery only a few applications 
have made it into approved therapeutic drugs. The key to success is the stability of the 
formulation and the ability to retain the encapsulated compound for a long time once it 
is loaded into a vesicle. The low solubility and high toxicity and/or unwanted site effects 
of many anti - cancer drugs make this class of compounds a logic choice for the use of 
encapsulation. Furthermore the discontinuous vascular blood vessels of tumours are leaky 
for small 200 – 1200   nm particles, and liposomes of 100 – 200   nm readily extravasate at the 
tumour site.  103

Molecular Encapsulation
 Efﬁ cient liposomal therapeutics also require long circulation times. Normal liposomes 
are cleared from the blood rapidly by the reticuloendothelial system, but circulation times 
can be easily increased by giving the liposomes a so - called stealth character.  104 Stealth 
liposomes are sterically stabilized by lipids with a long polyethylene glycol unit attached 
to the headgroup, usually phosphatidylethanolamine (PE).  105 
 Good encapsulations begin with vesicles in which any compound can be retained 
for a long time. One way to achieve this is by making the bilayer less permeable for 
the encapsulated compound. Although a phospholipid membrane is semipermeable, 
small molecules and monovalent ions can leak in and out, typical at a time span of 
hours. In the presence of serum, vesicles are usually more leaky than in buffer without 
serum albumin. Very often cholesterol is added to phospholipids vesicles to make them 
less permeable as was demonstrated by leakage experiments with carboxyﬂ uorescein 
(CF) and calcein.  106 Instead of membranes based on (phospho)lipids, the use of block 
copolymers, with the same basic architecture as lipids but with larger masses, that can 
form vesicles  107,108   (polymersomes) gains popularity.  109   Another way of making less 
permeable membranes, involves the use of newly discovered lipids like the laderanes 
from the anammoxosomes,  110,111   unique organelles in anammox bacteria, and multimethyl 
branched lipids from the membranes of archeabacteria.  112   Although results on their 
capabilities are limited at the moment,  113   the synthesis of these lipids became recently 
available   114 – 116   allowing large scale experiments on their possible usage as drug delivery 
capsules. 
 16.3.1  Encapsulated Drugs 
 One of the ﬁ rst encapsulated drugs that was reported was liposomal insulin for oral 
administration instead of the now used method of subcutaneous injection. Insulin, when 
administrated orally, is broken down in the digestive track, making it useless for sugar 
uptake from the blood. By encapsulation in bilayer vesicles the idea was that insulin could 
successfully be administrated orally. The shielding effect of the bilayer to prevent decom-
position could facilitate the delivery of intact insulin. The results, however, were incon-
sistent and an application was never launched. Although the basic idea was good, this 
method faced the major problems still involved in efﬁ cient encapsulation. To retain any 
encapsulated compound effectively is by making use of the low solubility limit of the 
compound either by itself or by gelating it with another compound.  117 This was nicely 
demonstrated for vesicles loaded with the anti - cancer drug doxorubicin or the antibiotic 
ciproﬂ oxacin. 118   Doxorubicin was actively loaded by a sulphate gradient.  119   Due to the 
low solubility of the precipitated doxorubicin (Figure  16.7 ) no leakage was observed even 
in serum containing media. On the other hand, ciproﬂ oxacin, with a much higher solubil-
ity limit leaked out of the vesicles on an hour ’ s time scale.  118 Doxorubicin - loaded vesicles 
are by now one of the best characterized liposomal drug formulations  120   approved for the 
treatment of several solid tumours. By encapsulation of the doxorubicin the effective dose 
could be increased whereas the large site effects, such as the breakdown of cardiac tissue, 
could be avoided. 121 
 Cisplatin is an effective and frequently used anti - cancer drug against a variety of solid 
tumours. The ﬁ rst trials of encapsulation faced the problem of low drug to lipid ratio due 
to the limited solubility of cisplatin resulting in low bioavailability. 122

437
 Effective encapsulation of cisplatin was achieved by multiple freeze thawing steps 
of neutral and cationic soluble cisplatin in the presence of anionic phospholipids like 
phosphatidylserine (PS).  123   By freezing the cisplatin is concentrated because the solute 
is expelled from the ice crystals. When the concentration limit is reached the neutral 
cisplatin, with the lowest solubility limit, aggregates followed by aggregation of 
positively - charged cisplatin when the solution further concentrates during the freezing. 
The negatively - charged PS collapses on the small particles resulting in small aggre-
gates covered by lipids.  124   In this way very high cisplatin to lipid ratios were achieved. 
 Today more than ten liposomal drug formulations have been approved for clinical 
use 125,126   and the number is growing. Ideally a liposomal encapsulated drug exhibits hardly 
any drug release in the blood plasma, but once at the designated site all its content should 
be released. 
 To trust only on mechanical instability by accumulation on a desired spot for the release 
of pay - load from vesicles is an imperfection of the system. By the incorporation of 
channel proteins in the bilayer of vesicles that can open or close upon a variety of 
signals 127   smart release of encapsulated substances is brought closer. Especially the modi-
ﬁ ed mechano - sensitive channel protein MscL  128,129   from Lactococcus lactis can be 
remotely controlled. The MscL can be modiﬁ ed to be responsive to light or pH  130 – 132 for 
the release of encapsulated compounds.

Molecular Encapsulation
 An alternative for encapsulation in vesicles is the use of low molecular weight hydro -
 gelators. Gels can retain solvents and solutes in the space between a dense network of 
intertwined ﬁ bres. Similar to encapsulated material by vesicles, gels can retain com-
pounds. Aqueous hydrogelators based on cyclohexyl - tris - amino acid can self - assemble 
in one direction through the establishment of H - bonds, leading to the formation of a ﬁ bre 
network and consequently macroscopic gels.  133   The formation of these gel networks was 
found to be independent from the self - assembly of phospholipids into vesicles which is 
driven by hydrophobic interaction. By encapsulating a gel network into liposomes (Figure 
 16.8 ) the advantages of both liposomes and gel networks can be combined in a single 
system. 134 
 Despite the high expectations only a handful of applications of liposome -  encapsulated 
drugs is available. Nevertheless the high potency of liposomes is still considered as very 
useful in this ﬁ eld and research is progressing.

clinique have already been successful using viral vectors for DNA trafﬁ cking 135 During 
the past decades, extensive research has been performed on the synthesis and testing of 
 non - viral vectors for delivering nucleic acids into living cells, both  in vitro and  in vivo . 
Examples include DOTMA ( N - (1 - (2,3 - dioleoyloxy)propyl) - N , N , N - trimethylammonium 
chloride), DOTAB ( n - dodecyl - trimethylammonium bromide), SAINT - 2 ( N - methyl - 4 -
 (dioleoyl)methylpyridinium chloride and sugar - based gemini surfactants. This work 
makes use of some of the most sophisticated applications of bilayer encapsulation. The 
vectors include cationic, bilayer - forming amphiphiles,  136 – 138   which are viewed as useful 
alternatives for virus - based delivery agents which may be associated with mutational and 
immunological hazards. These carriers are often used in combination with speciﬁ c phos-
pholipids. The transfection efﬁ ciencies of different commercially available cationic lipid -
 based transfection kits have been compared.  139   A number of biodegradable pyridinium 
amphiphiles have also been synthesized and exhibited remarkably high transfection 
efﬁ ciencies. 140 
 The literature on gene transfection is enormous and the results have been reviewed.  137,141,142 
We will focus here exclusively on nucleic acid encapsulation by vesicles and discuss 
some of the factors governing the interactions. The resulting lipoplexes may contain entire 
genes, (antisense) oligonucleotides  143 – 145   or RNA and small interference RNA (siRNA) 
and are in most cases obtained by adding the nucleic acid to preformed vesicles. 
 16.4.1  Lipoplex Formation 
 Lipoplex formation is very efﬁ cient (occurring on an ms time scale) with  cationic 
amphiphiles, indicating that the binding is primarily electrostatically driven. The ratio 
amphiphile/DNA is such that all negative charges of the DNA are involved in binding to 
positively charged headgroups of the amphiphiles, thereby leading to a concomitant con-
densation of DNA to a compact toroidal structure. There should be sufﬁ cient additional 
amphiphile to provide the lipoplex with an overall positive charge. These lipoplexes can 
then favorably interact with the negatively charged cell surface, for example with anionic 
proteoglycans. 
 Liposomes formed from natural phospholipids are either zwitterionic or carry a net 
negative charge. Using them as gene carriers, nucleic - acid binding must now rely mainly 
on entrapment into the aqueous pool of the liposomes. 
 There is compelling evidence that the efﬁ ciency of the delivery vehicle depends 
strongly on the ability of the lipoplex to interact with the cell surface, necessary for 
induction of transfer of the gene into the cellular interior. As will be discussed later, the 
cationic amphiphiles should possess the necessary properties for affecting transport  across 
the membrane and they should allow destabilization of the endosomal membrane and 
subsequent release of DNA into the cytosol for trafﬁ cking to the nuclear membrane. The 
latter step is a key factor in gene transfection. A variety of issues play a role here, 
including a favorable chemical constitution of the amphiphilic carrier, environmental 
factors, and intermingling of the vesicular phase of the lipoplex with selected phospholi-
pids that can provide endosomal membrane destabilization and a concomitant release of 
the bound DNA.  Endocytosis  is often considered to be the major entry pathway for this 
process. It has been shown that the complex internalization process can occur via the 
cholesterol - dependent clathrin - mediated pathway of endocytosis. 146,147 Evidence includes

Molecular Encapsulation
the observation that transfection is greatly inhibited when plasma membrane cholesterol 
is depleted with methyl -   β - cyclodextrin whereas cell - association remains unchanged. 
 Then, when delivered into the cytosol, the gene has to ﬁ nd its way to the cell nucleus, 
the site where transcription and replication will occur. A detailed recent study showed 
the crucial importance of nuclear transcription efﬁ ciencies. 148   In fact there are many 
individual steps that make up the gene transfection and mechanistic studies are performed 
to identify these steps and to ﬁ nd ways to facilitate these steps. 
 16.4.2  Lipoplex Structure 
 Lipoplexes can have several morphologies each possessing different transfection efﬁ cien-
cies. 142   The most frequently encountered structural phase is lamellar (  Lc
α) in which the 
DNA is sandwiched between the lamellae (Figure  16.9 ), as indicated by high resolution 
cryo - electron microscopy and SAXS measurements  149   as well as by X - ray diffraction.  150 
Their average size is about 200   nm, allowing a few of these lipoplexes to ﬁ t within an 
endosomal compartment. Mixing the cationic carrier with the phospholipid DOPE (mole 
fraction  > 0.4) leads to formation of a highly curved mesomorphic morphology, in this 
case an inverted hexagonal structure (  HII
c ) containing DNA rods coated with a monolayer 
of the amphiphile arranged on a hexagonal lattice. This phase is the favourable one for 
inducing efﬁ cient release of the DNA cargo from an (early) endosomal compartment in 
vitro. The hydrophobic outer - surface of inverted hexagonal lipoplexes make them not 
suitable for  in vivo  use. It has also been established that the   HII
c  phase plays an important 
role in destabilizing the endosomal membrane, thereby inducing efﬁ cient translocation of 
DNA across the endosomal membrane into the cytosol. 151 
 The effect of the helper lipid on the lipoplex morphology depends on control of the 
spontaneous radius of curvature of the bilayers and is dependent on its mole fraction 
(mf) in the bilayer. For example, for DOTAB/DOPE cocktails, a pure lamellar phase is 
formed when mf(DOPE) is  < 0.41. A pure  HII
c  phase is formed when mf(DOPE) is  > 0.75,

whereas both morphologies coexist for 0.41  <  mf(DOPE)  <  0.75. Increasing mole frac-
tions of DOPE lead to gradual dehydation of the DNA bases. Transformation of DOTAP/
DOPE systems into the   HII
c  phase was evidenced by small angle X - ray scattering (SAXS) 
and optical microscopy.  152   For SAINT - 2/DOPE cocktails a similar phase change, but 
now at high salt concentrations, was shown by NMR spectroscopy and SAXS 
measurements. 153,145,154 
 The transition from   Lc
α to   HII
c  can be rationalized by considering the packing parameter 
P (section  16.1.1 ). For bilayer forming carrier molecules, P is between 0.5 and 1.0, often 
close to 1.0; by contrast the phospholipid DOPE is cone - shaped and P is    >  1, leading to 
a preferred formation of an inverted hexagonal phase. 
 There is evidence that a transient spaghetti - like morphology can be formed between 
the  Lc
α and  HII
c  phases, acting as a precursor to the  HII
c  morphology. 155 
 We like to emphasize here, that the efﬁ ciency of a helper lipid like DOPE is, however, 
inﬂ uenced by the packing of the alkyl tails in the membrane formed by the cationic carrier 
amphiphile. This was demonstrated 156 by a comparative study of two structurally related 
bilayer - forming surfactants, SAINT - 2 (with two C18:1 tails) and SAINT - 5 (with two 
C18:0 tails) (Figure  16.10 ). Both carriers display transfection activity, but DOPE exerts 
a positive effect on SAINT - 2 - mediated transfection, but has a negligible effect on trans-
fection mediated by SAINT - 5. Interestingly, DOPE effectively enhances DNA dissocia-
tion from the lipoplexes formed from both carriers. Most likely, membrane stiffness plays 
an important role here. Since the bilayer composed of SAINT - 5 is more rigid than that 
formed from SAINT - 2, because of the absence of unsaturation in the tails, the plasmid 
DNA becomes less effectively condensed, and the lipoplex is structurally deformed. This 
has no effect on cellular uptake but reduces the efﬁ ciency of translocation of the plasmid 
across the membranes of the endosome and/or of the cell nucleus.   
 In contrast with supercoiled DNA, steric factors most likely prevent translocation of 
the uncondensed DNA from the endosome into the cytosol. Consistent with this interpre-
tation, the much smaller oligonucleotides are effectively translocated into cells by lipo-

consensus.  157 
 A third morphology that has recently been identiﬁ ed is an intercalated hexagonal struc-
ture in which three honeycombs of amphiphile micelles cover the DNA rods, thereby 
forming a normal, hexagonal lattice (  HI
c). This was found for the two sugar - based gemini 
surfactants GS1 and GS2 (Figure  16.11 ), for which the lipoplex forms an   Lc
α phase at 
physiological pH values as indicated by cryo - EM and SAXS  158 measurements. The phase 
transition after internalization of the lipoplex into the endosomes with a mildly acidic pH 
was examined using the solvatochromic ﬂ uorescent probe Nile Red.  73   In the resulting   HI
c 
phase the polar headgroups of the geminis are exposed on the outside in contact with 
water. 159   This in contrast to the earlier proposed   HII
c  phase for the lipoplexes.  158 As a 
consequence, these particles exhibit an unusually high colloidal stability (as shown 
by turbidity measurements) facilitating their application in  in vivo  gene delivery 
experiments.  160   In the   HII
c  phase the polar headgroups of the amphiphile participate in

electrostatic interactions with the DNA and the hydrophobic tails are exposed on the 
outside where they can easily induce aggregation behaviour and capture in the lung 
endothelium capillaries. This problem has been tackled by coating the lipoplexes with 
PEG - lipids that enhance the blood circulation times. 
 In Figure  16.12  the morphology of the   HI
c phase is compared with that of the   HII
c  phase 
formed from SAINT - 2 and DOPE. A similar   HI
c phase has previously been reported for 
lipoplexes composed of the single - tailed, micelle - forming surfactant CTAB.  161 In this 
phase the amphiphile monomers are dynamic and able to move in and out of the micelles. 
These properties allow translocation of endosomal lipids into the lipoplex thereby stimu-
lating release of DNA into the cytosol. 
 Oligonucleotides (ODNs) can function as effective gene - speciﬁ c regulators and have 
considerable therapeutic potential. Although small quantities of ODNs can be endocyto-
sized via adsorption, it is necessary to prevent their sequestering in endocytic compart-
ments. It has been shown 144   that SAINT - 2 can act as an effective carrier for speciﬁ c 
antisense ODNs to target mRNA. No problems with cytotoxicity were found. Using 
Chinese hamster ovary cells, the protein levels of the receptor for the neuropeptide

corticotropin -  releasing factor were assessed. ODN release did not depend on the size of 
the lipoplex and the presence of serum. However, in case serum proteins are incorporated 
into the lipoplex, the lipoplex membrane is stabilized, hampering ODN release. 
 For  in vivo applications, the circulation time of the ODN - carrier complex has to be 
increased. This was accomplished for the same cell type by incorporating complexes of 
PEG with either phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or ceramide. 145 The data suggested that 
cytosolic release of the ODNs from the endosomal compartment was inhibited by the 
PEG - lipid through stabilization of the lamellar phase of the lipoplexes. For a more 
detailed discussion of this important ﬁ eld, the interested reader is referred to recent 
reviews. 162,143 
 Rather surprisingly, it was found possible to form a lipoplex from DNA and a zwit-
terionic multilamellar phase at high lipid/DNA weight ratios.  163   The impetus for these 
studies was the lower cytotoxicity of neutral (and also negatively charged) liposomes. 
Encapsulation of DNA by soya bean diacylphosphatidylcholine (PC) was carried out by 
mixing the lipid (containing a small amount of a helper surfactant) and short DNA frag-
ments ( ca . 150 base pairs) in excess water and subsequent freeze - drying. The resulting 
dry powder was then hydrated with deionized water. SAXS measurements on these 
systems were in accord with a multilamellar structure with intercalated monolayer DNA 
between the neutral lipid layers, despite the absence of electrostatic binding interactions. 
The absence of signiﬁ cant DNA - lipid interactions was experimentally veriﬁ ed and as a 
consequence the DNA molecules possess more motional freedom than in the conventional 
 Lc
α complexes formed from cationic carrier systems. 
 Another remarkable lipoplex morphology was proposed in experiments in which short 
DNA fragments (either pure or marked with a ﬂ uorescent dye) were locally injected, using 
a micropipette, into a part of the membrane of a giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV, diameter 
 ca . 100  µ m). These vesicles were formed from phosphatidylcholines and upto 33   mol% 
of a cationic sphingosine by electroformation. 164 Membrane topology was observed in 
phase contrast, DNA distributions by ﬂ uorescence spectroscopy. Local DNA - lipid inter-
actions in the membrane induced endocytosis, which needed a minimum concentration 
of D - erythrosphingosine. At lower concentrations only lateral adhesions between neigh-
boring vesicles were found upon local addition of DNA. The size and shapes of the 
endosomes were dependent on the kind of DNA and the initial GUV membrane tension. 
 Although the evidence was not fully compelling, it was suggested that DNA - lipid 
interactions involved DNA encapsulation within a cylindrical inverted micelle, included 
in the lipid membrane (Figure  16.13 ). 
 Gene expression was veriﬁ ed in cell - sized, giant vesicles formed from DOPC/DOPG 
(10   :   1). In individual vesicles expression was found of red - shifted green ﬂ uorescent 
protein (rsGFP) using ﬂ uorescence spectroscopy. 165   Particularly in the early stage of the 
reaction, expression inside the vesicle was signiﬁ cantly higher than that in bulk aqueous 
solution. Interestingly, the rsGFP synthesized in the vesicles is protected from attack by 
proteinase K that was added to the external aqueous medium. 
 A lot of work has been done to ﬁ nd out how lipoplexes and lipoplex - cell interactions 
respond to the presence of serum. Many relevant references are cited in a paper published 
in 2002  166   that reports how lipoplex stability and processing are affected by serum. The 
cationic surfactant carrier was SAINT - 2 using DOPE as the helper lipid. Previous studies 
had already shown that transfection efﬁ ciencies are reduced in the presence of serum, in

accord with the results for SAINT - 2 lipoplexes. In the absence of serum, clustered lipo-
plexes (  −  FBS lipoplexes, FBS is fetal bovine serum) were observed. Clustering did  not 
occur in the presence of serum ( + FBS lipoplexes) or when serum was present during 
lipoplex formation (FBS lipoplexes). Interestingly, the topology of DNA in FBS lipo-
plexes changes from a supercoiled conformation (as also in   −  FBS lipoplexes) to a pre-
dominantly open - circular conformation. This leads to faster digestion by DNase. Most 
signiﬁ cant was the observation that internalization of   −  FBS and  + FBS lipoplexes is about 
three times slower than that of FBS lipoplexes although their transfection efﬁ ciencies are 
about ﬁ ve times higher. The data indicate that smaller serum protein - penetrated particles 
cannot fast enough release their DNA from pre - lysosomal endocytic compartments and 
are delivered to lysosomes where they are prone to degradation pathways. Size and mor-
phology of the lipoplex govern their ability to interact with and perturb cell membranes, 
processes that are needed for release of the gene. Serum regulates these processes in an 
amphiphile - dependent manner through complex  ‘ penetration ’  and modulation of the DNA 
conformation.  
 16.4.3  Future Prospects 
 It will be clear that DNA encapsulation by vesicles is the starting point for gene transfec-
tion. In a complex follow - up, DNA is ﬁ nally transported to the cell nucleus. The variety 
of factors determining transfection efﬁ ciencies, including lipoplex size and zeta potential, 
incubation time, cytotoxicity and lipoplex morphology, both  in vitro  and  in vivo , are still 
under active investigation. The ﬁ nal goal is a successful and safe application in the cli-
nique. Our attention here was only focused on lipoplex formation, their structure and 
properties. The results obtained so far overwhelmingly show the complex features of 
DNA encapsulation by the cationic amphiphilic carrier systems. Insight into these issues 
as embedded in a realistic mechanistic picture of the whole transfection process might 
ultimately give the desired success.

Reactions in Liposomes

 17.1  Introduction 
 Compartmentalized reactions belong to a class of molecular reacting systems, which play 
a fundamental role in our understanding of cellular life. In fact, the most striking property 
of living systems is their cellular nature, and the fact that life is based on reactions that 
are organized by a functional as well as spatial point of view. In the last decades, cellular 
biology has provided a great amount of evidences about the structure and dynamics of 
living cells, by  in vivo  or  ex vivo  investigations. Such approach  –  that can be deﬁ ned as 
 ‘ analytical ’   –  has been germane to our comprehension of several mechanisms, but is, in 
some aspects, not sufﬁ cient. There are two reasons that lie at the basis of modern studies 
on compartmentalized reactions: the ﬁ rst is related to the need of a complementary 
approach, that we may call  ‘ synthetic ’ or  ‘ constructive ’ , 1 – 3   since it tries to understand 
cells by constructing more or less elaborated models of them. This point of view can be 
summarized by the famous Feynman ’ s sentence  ‘ What I cannot create, I do not under-
stand ’ . The second reason is related to the tradition of artiﬁ cial life and origins of life 
studies, where great efforts have been carried out to produce synthetic analogues of living 
cells, or to reproduce  –  at least as proof of principle  –  the steps that led to the transition 
from inanimate matter to the ﬁ rst living protocell. It is within this conceptual framework 
that the study of reactions in compartments (and inside lipid vesicles, in particular) have

currently witnessed an enormous rise of interest, that has also catalyzed an ever - growing 
number of scientists involved in such research. Synthetic biology,  4 – 6 a new - born subject 
that combines molecular biology with an engineering approach, can be perhaps consid-
ered as the proper ﬁ eld where microcompartmentalized reactions belong to, even if some 
conceptual differences have been pointed out.  1,3   More in general, however, we can look 
at these studies as investigations on molecular self - organization and on the physical -
 molecular basis of living process. 
 In this chapter, we will introduce the basic concepts of reactions inside vesicles, 
describing ﬁ rst the self - assembly nature of lipid and fatty acid vesicles, which are very 
important cell models (it has been suggested that fatty acid vesicles represent the most 
plausible candidates for protocells). Then, the experimental strategies and some theoreti-
cal aspects will be presented and discussed, in order to give a general view on the subject. 
In the last part, we will discuss some speciﬁ c examples of reactions in liposomes, giving 
much emphasis to the technical advancements and open questions, but commenting also 
on the relevance of such studies for synthetic biology and origins of life. More in particu-
lar, we will focus on the issue of  ‘ semi - synthetic minimal cell ’ , 7   that we  –  and others  – are 
currently pursuing and developing. 
 17.2  Lipid Vesicles (Liposomes) 
 17.2.1  What are Liposomes (and Fatty Acid Vesicles) 
 Lipid vesicles (namely, liposomes), as well as fatty acid vesicles, form spontaneously in 
aqueous solution by a self - assembly process. The building blocks of liposomes are natural 
or synthetic phospholipids (Figure  17.1 A), which are water - insoluble amphiphilic mol-
ecules formed generally by two hydrophobic chains and a polar (charged) headgroup. The 
formation of bilayers by phospholipids is qualitatively predicted by geometrical consid-
erations based on the so - called surfactant parameter.  8   In the case of fatty acids (Figure 
 17.1 B), bilayers form only within a determined pH range (for oleic acid vesicles, around 
pH 8.5    ±    1 pH unit), because the protonation state of the carboxylate group strongly 
affects the self - assembly properties of such molecules. At high pH, fatty acids, being 
deprotonated, assemble as micelles; at low pH, fatty acids separate from the solution as 
oil droplets. At intermediate pH values, fatty acids and their salts coexist in the membrane, 
which results stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds.  9   The fact that fatty acids assem-
ble as bilayers at intermediate pH and as micelles at high pH can be viewed and explained 
as a change of surfactant parameter (from cylidrical to conical shape). Phospholipid vesi-
cles and fatty acid vesicles have several common properties, but differ in some key 
aspects: for example, both form only above critical aggregate concentrations (typically 
10  − 10    M for phospolipids, and around 10  − 4 – 10  − 2    M for fatty acids, depending on their chain 
length). Fatty acids, in fact, are more soluble than phospholipids, due to their molecular 
structure, which presents only one hydrophobic chain instead of two, and a polar and 
exposed ionic head group. This difference affects also the molecular dynamics of the 
systems: phospholipid membranes are more  ‘ frozen ’ , whereas fatty acid membranes are 
more  ‘ dynamic ’ . 
 It is important to remark that the formation of membrane bilayers is guided by the 
entropically driven hydrophobic effect.  10   Spherical or spheroidal liposomes, which form

by different mechanisms,  11   differ in their size and morphology, mainly depending on the 
chemical nature of lipids, physico - chemical parameters (temperature, ionic strenght, pH, 
etc), and also according to the method of liposome preparation, as will be discussed later. 
In Figure  17.2 , some typical size/shape of liposomes are shown. 
 Two important aspects of liposome formation must be emphasized here. First, in some 
cases we observe the formation of ordered supramolecular structures starting from a 
chaotic disordered mixture of surfactants (as in the ethanol injection method  12 ). As noticed 
before, this increase of order is attended by a simultaneous increase of water entropy and 
a decrease of overall free energy (lipids  and  solvent). Secondly, every time a liposome 
forms, there is the  ‘ emergence ’  of a division, with an inside world that is different from 
the external environment, even if the two worlds actually interact with each other. The 
discrimination between inside and outside, applicable to lipid vesicles, is the ﬁ rst struc-
tural pre - requisite for the living cell. It is therefore clear that lipid or fatty acid vesicles 
may be considered relevant experimental model of simpliﬁ ed cells, and their role on

(A); oleic acid/oleate dimer (through hydrogen bond) (B); oleate (C). The values of 
surfactant parameters are shown on the right, as well as the approximate surfactant shape. 
Surfactants with cylindrical geometry ( p  ∼  1) generally form bilayer, and therefore vesicles; 
surfactants with conical geometry ( p  <  0.5) generally form micelles. Notice that oleate 
may have different  p values according to the pH. When the ionization degree is about 
50%, oleate bilayers are stabilized by a network of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Other 
fatty acids behave similarly

origins of life is today greatly acknowledged. Further discussion on the emergence of 
compartments and their relevance to the origins of life, can be ﬁ nd in Luisi (2006). 1 
 17.2.2  Morphology and Methods of Preparation 
 Liposomes can be prepared according to different methods. Classical discussions  11,13 focus 
on the preparation of phospholipid vesicles, whereas the preparation of fatty acid vesicles 
has been reviewed only recently. 14 
 The key point is that different preparation methods produce different vesicle samples, 
in terms of size, morphology and size distribution (this observation provides a further 
conﬁ rmation on the non - equilibrium nature of vesicle samples). A collection of vesicle 
types is shown in Figure  17.2 . Unilamellar vesicles (UVs) are generally classiﬁ ed as 
small, large or giant ones (SUVs, LUVs, or GUVs, respectively); SUVs have very small 
diameters ( < 50  nm), whereas LUVs ’  diameters span from 50 to about 400   nm. Notice that 
it is difﬁ cult to produce large vesicles which are truly unilamellar; very often they are 
bi -  or oligo - lamellar. Giant vesicles are very large vesicles ( > 1  µ m) that can be visualized 
by a light microscope; they are generally oligo -  or multilamellar, but thanks to special 
methods, 15   it is possible to produce GUVs. Unilamellar vesicles are the most useful vesi-
cles since the dependence of their properties from the number of lamella has been elimi-
nated. As a consequence, it is expected that their physico - chemical properties depend 
mainly from their size. Moreover, diffusion of solutes inside unilamellar vesicles is 
simpler than in other cases, and can be therefore clearly explained. Unfortunately, most 
 Figure 17.2   Size and morphology of vesicles. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) are 
generally small ( < 50  nm); large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) have size between 50   nm and 
few hundreds nanometers; multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) have an indeﬁ nite number of 
concentric lamellae and are generally larger than LUVs; multivesicular vesicles (MVVs) are 
formed by several smaller vesicles (uni - , oligo - , or multilamellar) within the cavity of a 
larger (uni - , oligo - , or multilamellar) vesicle. Giant vesicles are very large vesicles (in the 
micrometer range) of various lamellarity. If unilamellar, they are called giant unilamellar 
vesicles (GUVs). It is often impossible to ﬁ x a size limit to each vesicle class; different size 
and morphologies are often possible

of the common preparation methods  –  as we will see later  –  do not produce unilamellar 
vesicles. The typical outcome of lipid hydration procedures is a sample of oligo - or mul-
tilamellar vesicles (OLVs, MLVs), or more complex structures as multivesicular vesicles 
(MVVs). Such particles, which have a variable morphology and an unpredictable number 
of lamellae can be used for some applications, but in most reﬁ ned studies are ﬁ rst con-
verted into unilamellar ones. It is remarkable that unilamellar vesicles have of course 
higher total entrapped volume when compared to OLVs, MLVs, or MVVs of same size, 
since the architecture of each compartment involves the smallest possible lipid quantity, 
and therefore the number of compartments is higher than the opposite case (in MLVs, 
several lipid bilayer are  ‘ wasted ’  to build the compartment boundary). It is therefore clear 
that unilamellar vesicles are the preferred containers to carry out microcompartmentalized 
reactions. 
 Let us discuss brieﬂ y the main preparation methods of phospholipid vesicles (Figure 
 17.3 ). The formation of vesicles takes place when lipids are dispersed in water; the dif-
ferent methods differ for the way this dispersion occurs.  
 In the thin ﬁ lm hydration method, lipids are ﬁ rst stratiﬁ ed on a very large surface, in 
order to make a very thin ﬁ lm (generally in a round - bottom glass ﬂ ask). Within the thin 
ﬁ lm, which form by evaporation from a lipid/solvent solution, lipids are already organized 
as bilayers. After hydration of the ﬁ lm, large vesicle (MLVs) arise, entrapping solvent 
and solutes in their aqueous core and between lamellae. Vesicles are then processed in 
order to reduce lamellarity and size, to produce SUVs or LUVs. This process is generally 
done by freezing and thawing the vesicles in liquid nitrogen, followed by extrusion; 
alternatively, and at the same aim, vesicles can also be treated with ultrasounds. If the 
lipid ﬁ lm is done on rod electrodes, and hydration is accomplished by applying alternate 
voltage, GUVs emerge from the electrodes surface.  15,16 
 The reverse - phase evaporation method 17 starts from water - in - oil (w/o) compartments, 
obtained by dispersing a small amount of an aqueous solution (the same that needs to be 
entrapped in the vesicles) in a lipid - containing solution, such an ether/chloroform solu-
tion. Lipids stabilize the formation of such droplets. After solvent evaporation the com-
partments collapse to give ﬁ rst a gel and then a dispersion of uni -  and oligolamellar 
vesicles, with size ranging from 100 to 500   nm. The advantage of this method is the high 
entrapment yield (notice that the starting point is already a  ‘ 100% inside ’ compartmental-
ized state); the disadvantage is the use of organic solvents, which may be dangerous for 
some solutes (e.g. folded proteins). 
 The detergent depletion method also starts from a special organization form: the mixed 
micelles. When lipids are mixed with excess detergent in aqueous solution, lipids are 
 ‘ solubilized ’  in the detergent micelles. When detergent is slowly removed by gel ﬁ ltration 
chromatography or dialysis, the mixed micelles transform into phospholipid vesicles. The 
method works because the detergent molecules are also present as monomer, in equilib-
rium with the micelle, and the exchange of aqueous phase brings to a slow detergent 
depletion via monomer removal. The method produces SUVs or LUVs, entrapping the 
solutes present in the aqueous phase used to remove the detergent. The high concentration 
of detergents, often needed during the preparation step, may be a disadvantage when 
sensitive solutes must be entrapped. 
 With the ethanol (or methanol) injection method  12   a small aliquot of an alcoholic lipid 
solution (where lipids are likely present as monomer species) is simply injected into a

 Figure 17.3   Four classical methods of liposome preparation. (I) Thin ﬁ lm hydration 
method. Lipids are solubilized in apolar solvents (chloroform, ether) and stratiﬁ ed as dry 
thin ﬁ lm on a solid support (generally glass). After hydration and shaking, liposomes form 
(very often MLVs MVVs). Formation of GVs by natural swelling method also require the 
formation of stratiﬁ ed lipids on the wall of container; GVs electroformation starts from 
stratiﬁ ed lipids on electrodes; (II) Reverse phase evaporation. To a solution of lipids in 
chloroform/ether, a small aliquot of aqueous phase is added and sonicated, in order to 
form a water - in - oil emulsion. After controlled solvent evaporation, a gel form, that

method. A solution of mixed micelles (lipid plus excess detergent) is processed so that the 
detergent amount is reduced, by dialysis, gel ﬁ ltration chromatography or by dilution. 
Liposomes form slowly due to the low ﬁ nal detergent/lipid ratio. Typically, SUVs or LUVs 
are generated. This method is often used to reconstitute membrane proteins in liposomes, 
starting from mixed micelles containing a membrane protein. (IV) Ethanol injection 
method. A small aliquot (1 – 5% v/v) of a lipid solution in ethanol or methanol in injected 
in an aqueous solution. Liposomes form immediately due to ethanol dilution in water 
phase. The liposome size depends on the lipid concentration in alcohol. Working with 
diluted solution, it is possible to form SUVs. In all methods, liposomes entrap the water -
 soluble compounds that present in the aqueous solution. High entrapment yields are 
obtained by rehydrating freeze - dried liposomes. This method is reminescent of method I, 
but starts from lipid preorganized in different way (freeze - dried liposomes probably have 
partially conserved lipid bilayers)

large amount of aqueous solution, containing the solute(s) to be entrapped. Ethanol mixes 
with water and liposome forms within the mixing time. Interestingly, such method pro-
vides a one - step way to form unilamellar vesicles (SUVs or LUVs), and the main factor 
governing the size and morphology of resultant vesicles is the lipid concentration in 
ethanol. 18,19   The presence of ethanol (or methanol) in the ﬁ nal dispersion may be disad-
vantageous, but in many cases it is limited to few units percent. 
 In addition to these classical methods, two special methods must be mentioned, due to 
their advantageous entrapment yield. The ﬁ rst is based on the rehydration of freeze - dried 
liposomes, which are in turn prepared from  ‘ empty ’  liposomes or from liposomes that 
already contain the solute(s) of interest.  20 – 22 Upon rehydration, freeze - dried vesicles 
reform and entrap the solute in high concentration. The second is a new method for pro-
ducing GVs starting from large w/o emulsion droplets, which are centrifuged through a 
lipid - rich macroscopic oil – water interface. The w/o droplets become covered with an 
external lamella during the passage through the oil – water interface, and are transformed 
into GVs, with the advantage of keeping inside their content.  23   Many of the most recent 
works on biocomparmentalized reactions are carried out in lipid vesicles formed by the 
latter two methods. 
 Fatty acid vesicles, which are stable only in a rather restricted pH range, can be pre-
pared: (1) by direct dispersion of fatty acids or their salts in an aqueous phase; (2) by the 
ﬁ lm method (when feasible); or (3) by acidiﬁ cation of an alkaline fatty acid salt micelles 
solution. In general, all preparation methods lead to a heterogeneous vesicle population; 
in special conditions, however, a narrowly sized vesicle population can be obtained by 
an autocatalytic process. 24,25 
 As a ﬁ nal remark, it is clear that the choice of liposome preparation method depends 
on the experiment ’ s aim. Since we are dealing with compartmentalized reactions, it is 
often convenient to reach the maximum entrapment efﬁ ciency, in order to have  ‘ ﬁ lled ’ 
vesicles. We will see in next section what are the general strategies to entrap chemicals 
inside vesicles, and how to feed them with an externally added reactant. Another impor-
tant issue, discussed below, is the chemical compatibility between the lipids, the prepara-
tion method, and the (bio)chemicals used in the experiments. 
 We conclude this survey on vesicle preparation methods by noticing that there are not 
standard method to prepare unilamellar vesicles in the range 0.5 – 1  µ m, although this size 
would be rather convenient for carrying out compartmentalized reactions (large trapped 
volume, possibility to employ modern visualization techniques, or high - throughput 
techniques). 
 17.2.3  Chemical Compatibility 
 There are two aspects pertinent to chemical compatibility and the design and the realiza-
tion of reactions inside vesicles. The ﬁ rst concerns the chemical structure of lipids (or 
fatty acids, or other co - surfactants, as ammonium salts, derivatized lipids, or sterols), the 
second is related to the preparation method. 
 Among phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) is certainly the less reactive, 
whereas anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and 
phosphatidic acid are of course sensitive to cations (e.g., Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ ; phosphatidic acid 
is sensitive to H +  too), to polyamines (spermine, spermidine, etc.), or basic proteins. Fatty

acids vesicles, stable at weakly alkaline pH, are also negatively charged, and therefore 
sensitive to H +  (a pH increase or decrease transform fatty acid vesicles into micelles and 
oil droplets, respectively), to divalent cations, and to basic proteins.  26 The latter point 
deserves a particular mention since it may prevent the use of fatty acid vesicles as com-
partment for Mg 2+  - dependent biochemical reactions. To date, the best way to make fatty 
acid vesicles compatible with such kind of chemicals is the addition of fatty acids –
 glycerol monoesters. 27,28   Cationic surfactant, generally based on ammonium salts, may be 
not compatible with anionic solutes (calcein, a classical water - soluble negatively charged 
probe used in vesicle research, interact with some cationic surfactant), and with poly-
anions like RNAs and DNAs. It has been recently reported that cell - free protein expres-
sion is inhibited by cationic liposomes 29 in a dose - dependent manner. 
 The preparation method may also present some constrains. For example, the thin ﬁ lm 
hydration is the only method which does not require the presence of additional compounds 
(reverse phase evaporation is carried out in the presence of organic solvents; the detergent 
depletion in the presence of detergent; and the ethanol injection, in the presence of 
ethanol) and it is therefore the only method of general use. However, it requires additional 
steps for vesicle processing because it produces a heterogeneous population of large 
MLVs. The reverse phase evaporation method, which is very convenient in terms of 
entrapment efﬁ ciency (10 – 40%), suffers of the presence of organic solvents, so that pro-
teins or other bio - supramolecular complex may lose their activity. Such preparation 
method, however, is applicable to inorganic or simple organic reactions. Similar consid-
erations apply to detergent - based methods and ethanol injection procedures. It has been 
reported that ethanol (3.5% v/v) and methanol (5% v/v) halves the yield of cell - free 
protein expression. 30 
 In conclusion, chemical compatibilities must be considered at the very beginning in 
the process of designing a microcompartmentalized bioreactor, and this will affect the 
choice of lipids as well as the preparation procedure.   
 17.3  Experimental Strategies and Theoretical Aspects 
 17.3.1  Basic Strategies 
 The result of the preparative methods sketched above is a vesicle suspension, where 
individual vesicles may or may not contain the solute(s) of interest. We should now 
perform a reaction inside the vesicle, and at this point, two different approaches must be 
distinguished. One is the case where the resulting vesicles still miss one (or more) 
reactant(s) necessary for the reaction under study (Figure  17.4 A), whereby the missing 
reactant(s) is deliberately not included in the hydrating solution. The other is the case 
where all reactants are present in the hydrating solution, so that fully  ‘ functional ’ vesicles 
may be present in the sample (Figure  17.4 B). In the ﬁ rst case the compartmentalized 
reaction cannot start until the missing reactant is added; in the second case, when all 
reactants are provided from the beginning, one must ﬁ nd some way so that the reaction 
does not start right away, namely it should start only when the compartmentation of all 
components has taken place. Notice, in fact, that in order to follow the reaction inside 
vesicles, in both strategies, the external  – the non - entrapped  –  material should be removed, 
destroyed or inhibited.

Reactions in Liposomes

 Let us discuss a general case where the reaction under study is modeled by the equation 
X  +  Y  →  Z. 
 The strategy indicated in Figure  17.4 A involve the vesicle formation in the presence 
of the reactant X (let us suppose, for the sake of simplicity; that X is a single chemical 
species). Depending on the conditions, not all vesicles may contain X, and certainly the 
numerical distribution of X inside the vesicles is centered around an average value, so 
that vesicles should be considered heterogeneous in terms of internal composition. We 
will discuss this theoretical aspect later. The ﬁ rst step is the removal of free (the non 
encapsulated) X from the system, and this is generally accomplished by dialysis, gel 
ﬁ ltration chromatography, ultracentrifugation or ultraﬁ ltration. For successful procedures, 
the external X and the vesicles are separated from each other due to different physical 
properties, such as molecular weight, size, or density. An alternative strategy involves 
the addition of a component that is able to inhibit the external (and only the external) 
reaction. 
 Now, in order to make the reaction possible, the second reactant Y must be added. In 
Figure  17.4 A it is shown the addition of Y in the external phase, followed by the diffusion 
of Y inside the vesicles. The ﬁ nal state is the product Z, synthesized inside the vesicle. 
This way is the simplest one, but requires that the Y permeability coefﬁ cient differs from 
zero. Moreover, if the entrance of Y in the vesicles becomes rate - limiting, the observed 
reaction rate will be limited by this slow step. 
 Figure 17.4   Two general strategies to carry out a compartmentalized reaction 
 ‘ X   +  Y  =  Z ’ . (A) Liposomes are formed in the presence of X, which is entrapped; then the 
free (unentrapped) X is removed, and later the second reactant Y is added. (B) Liposomes 
are formed in the presence of reactants X and Y, unentrapped material is removed (or a 
not - permeant inhibitor is added). The reaction is then started by physical means (e.g., 
temperature, light). X and Y may represent a single chemical specie, or a collection of 
reactants. When two or more reactants are simultaneously entrapped, the issue of 
 composition  of individual liposome may become relevant for interpretation of data. In 
panel B, for example, not all liposomes contain  both X and Y (this condition may become 
critical for a large number of reactants)

Molecular Encapsulation
 Figure  17.5  shows some possibilities, alternative to the passive diffusion (Figure 
 17.5 .1). The diffusion of Y into a vesicle which contains already X is useful when the 
permeability of Y is much higher than X ’ s one. A typical example is the entrapment of 
an enzyme inside vesicles, and the addition of its substrate(s)  –  generally small molecules 
 –  from outside. For a review on enzymes inside vesicles, strategies, and applications, 
see. 31 
 Fusion among two or more vesicles, each containing different solutes, can be a way to 
reach the desired reactant mixtures (Figure  17.5 .2). Vesicles can fuse under the effect of 
electrostatic forces (as in the case of cationic and anionic vesicles  32,33  ), or by some bridg-
ing agent such as Ca 2+ for phosphatidylserine vesicles, 34 or dehydrating agents like 
poly(ethylenglycol).  35   Although fusion rarely occurs at high yield, the idea of using 
vesicle fusion to build artiﬁ cial cells has been already suggested  1,36   and recently imple-
mented by means of fusogenic peptides. 37 
 The technique of microinjection (Figure  17.5 .3) bypasses the problem of low mem-
brane permeability, or even the entire entrapment step, by direct injecting the reactants 
inside GVs. This technique has been used in combination with GVs electroformation, as 
an approach to minimal cells. 16

Reactions in Liposomes 
465
 Another method relies on thermal properties of lipid membranes. Every lipid bilayer 
is characterized by a phase transition, from solid - like to liquid - like states. It is known that 
at the transition temperature (called  ‘ melting ’  temperature,  T m ), the bilayer permeability 
is maximal.  38   It is then possible to exploit this higher permeability to allow solutes pass 
through the membrane (Figure  17.5 .4). It has been reported, for example, that ATP per-
meability increase by a factor  ∼ 100 in dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles,  39 and 
that such vesicles can therefore be fed with ATP by keeping them at the  T m (23.3  ° C). It 
has been suggested that membrane defects are involved in the mechanism of enhanced 
permeability. Recent applications of this method have been reported.  40,41 This physical 
principle can be generalized  –  for instance  –  as thermal cycles around  T m . 42 Notice that 
the application of freeze - thawing cycles (in liquid nitrogen) is a common laboratory 
practice for equalizing internal and external liposome content. Although it likely proceeds 
by rough membrane integrity destruction, the concept of permeation of solute through 
 ‘ damaged ’  membrane is somehow similar to the case of permeation at the melting point. 
 Another possible way to reduce the barrier to free diffusion provided by lipid bilayer 
involves the use of detergents at sub - lytic concentrations, as membrane dopants (Figure 
 17.5 .5). An example is given by the cholate - induced ADP  43 or glucose - 1 - phosphate 
entrance 44 inside 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - phosphatidylcholine (POPC) vesicles. For example, 
the permeability of ADP can be increased by a factor 10, when cholate/POPC   =   4/5 (mol/
mol). 
 Finally, a more elaborate molecular approach has been recently developed, as shown 
in Figure  17.5 .6. It makes use of natural pore - forming molecules, such as porins,  45 – 48 or 
 α - hemolysin. 49 
 The advantage of such approach is the possible selective effects deriving from the 
molecular weight cut - off, set by the pore size. It is then possible that small molecules 
may penetrate and react into the vesicles, whereas large macromolecules (such as enzymes, 
nucleic acids) are retained inside. 
 After this discussion on the methods to feed vesicles by externally added reactants, let 
us focus again of Figure  17.4 B where an alternative way to the ﬁ rst route (Figure  17.4 A) 
is shown: the encapsulation  –  from the beginning  –  of all required reactants inside vesi-
cles. As in the previous case (Figure  17.4 A), the ﬁ rst step is the removal of external 
reactants, or the inhibition of external reaction. Notice that this step becomes now critical, 
since all reactants are present in the vesicles  as well as  in the external phase. It is clear 
that such approach can be followed only if there is a way to trig the reaction by some 
physical mean. A classical example is the vesicle entrapment of the whole biochemical 
machinery for transcription and translation reactions (from DNA to messenger RNA, and 
from messenger RNA to protein, respectively). The reactions do not proceed at any sig-
niﬁ cant extent at low temperatures (0 – 5  ° C) and can be triggered by incubating the sample 
at 37  ° C. Then the sample, kept at low temperature, is quickly manipulated by adding an 
inhibitor (that is not capable to enter the vesicle), or by exchanging the external phase by 
spin column gel chromatography, and later incubated at high temperature. In addition to 
this example of thermal trig, when possible, photochemical triggering can also be an 
opportunity. 
 The ﬁ nal step of every experiment with compartmentalized reactions is the product 
detection. This depends on the nature of the products, and in some cases by those of the 
reactants. It is evident that any analytical technique can be used in this respect, and direct 
chemical analysis should be preferred. When, however, real - time analysis is required,

only non - destructive methods can be applied, and in this respect the use of optical methods 
is very intriguing, but it also requires some caution. Lipid and fatty acid vesicles, in fact, 
strongly interfere with the spectrophotometric or spectroﬂ uorimetric detection of analytes. 
The discussion of this issue lies outside the purpose of this chapter, and the reader is 
referred to specialized literature. 
 17.3.2  Theoretical Aspects 
 In this section we will discuss brieﬂ y some theoretical aspects related to the design and 
realization of compartmentalized reactions, mainly derived from our experience with 
biochemical systems. As a general premise, we remark that although an ever increasing 
number of published work on this subject (mono -  or multi - enzymatic reactions inside 
liposomes, fatty acid vesicles, polymersomes,  50,51   as well as w/o  52   or w/o/w compart-
ments 53 ) a full understanding of the physico - chemical details of compartmentalized reac-
tions has not been reached. A related ﬁ eld, which has a longer tradition, i.e. that one of 
enzymes in reverse micelles has revealed interesting compartmentation - dependent 
mechanisms.  54 
 The main question is if  –  and to what extent  –  a reaction occurring inside a micrometric 
or submicrometric compartments differs from the same reaction in the bulk, and whether 
the formation of the compartment itself brings about novel effects. Clearly, these theoreti-
cal questions have great relevance in basic science, since the basic unit of life is itself a 
compartment (the biological cell), as well as in applications of compartmentalized systems 
for biotechnology (e.g. artiﬁ cial cells, biosensors, etc.). 55 
 We have recently discussed some of these theoretical issues in a publication.  36 Here 
we present some arguments on: ( i ) the local concentration of compartmentalized sub-
stances; ( ii ) the entrapment of solutes; ( iii ) the reactivity of solutes inside compartments. 
The reader should understand these discussions not as conclusive, but as a contribution 
to the ongoing research, and maybe feel stimulated to make research efforts in these 
directions. 
 ( i )  Local concentration . When a real vesicle sample is prepared in order to carry out 
internal molecular reactions, it is often useful to know what is the concentration of solutes 
inside the aqueous phase present in the interior of vesicles. The experimentally accessible 
quantity, however, is generally the total amount of solute (e.g., an enzyme) entrapped 
inside the total volume of all vesicles. In fact, with the exception of very large compart-
ments as GVs and w/o or w/o/w compartments, it is generally difﬁ cult to determine the 
individual composition of each vesicle. Electron microscopy may help in some special 
cases, 56,57 and modern ﬂ ow - cytometric techniques have been applied only very recently, 
and for large vesicles.  58   Complex analytical methods have been also used;  59 whereas the 
large size of GVs favours the direct analysis, so that concentration hetereogeneity has 
been promptly observed.  60   The interest toward the determination of individual vesicle 
content is justiﬁ ed by the fact that the theoretical treatment based on the concept of  ‘ water -
 pool ’  – or pseudo - phase  – introduced for reverse micelle systems, cannot be applied in 
the case of vesicles. In fact, whereas in reverse micelles the highly dynamic nature of 
such compartment (that allows solute exchange) average out the individual micelle diver-
sity, liposomes and fatty acid vesicles are characterized by a proper individuality. Far for 
being a disadvantage, such individuality is an important prerequisite for their use as cell

467
models and for their relevance as plausible protocells. Liposomes, in fact, do not fuse in 
absence of speciﬁ c triggers, 61   and do not exchange their content. This fact ultimately 
derives from the well know kinetically - trapped nature of lipid vesicles,  62,63   in contrast to 
reverse micelles, which are classical equilibrium systems. As a main consequence of this 
behaviour, it is expected (and observed) that a population of vesicles is heterogenous in 
terms of internalized solutes. The experimentally observed quantity, however, is often the 
total amount of entrapped solute, for example: 50 pmoles of a certain enzyme have been 
entrapped in 1   mL of 10   mM phosphatidylcholine liposomes (radius 50   nm). The  average 
enzyme concentration inside liposomes can be calculated, estimating the total entrapped 
volume of such liposomes (31    µ L/mL), to give  ca . 1.6  µ M. However, this average con-
centration corresponds to an  average  number of 0.5 enzyme molecules/vesicle. Clearly, 
no half - enzyme molecule will be present in any compartment, and a rough estimate may 
say that 50% of the compartments will contain no enzyme and the other 50% will contain 
just one enzyme. The expected number of enzymes inside vesicles can be predicted by 
means of the Poisson distribution,  30,58,64   which gives, in this case, the probability values 
reported in Figure  17.6 A. We can translate this values in the following physical meaning: 
ca. 60% of liposomes will be empty,  ca . 30% will contain 1 enzyme,  ca . 8% will contain 
2 enzymes and so on. The analysis of the reaction, e.g. in this case the enzyme - catalyzed 
conversion of a substrate into a product, if carried out by averaging techniques ( ‘ batch ’ 
photometry or ﬂ uorimetry, or chemical analysis) cannot reveal this vesicle 
heterogeneity. 
 A second theoretical issue on local concentration is trickier and can be discussed as it 
follows. Chemists normally express molecular concentrations in terms of mole per litre 
(molarity), a 1   M solution being composed by 6.023    ×  10 23 molecules  L  − 1 . Molar concen-
tration can be  calculated  from the number of molecules present is a certain volume. So, 
for instance, we can refer again to the above mentioned case, e.g., a system of 2 enzyme 
molecules in a vesicle volume of 0.5   aL (10  − 18  L); where the  calculated  enzyme concentra-
tion is 6.3  µ M. We may ask, however, if this tiny 6.3    µ M enzyme solution behaves really 
as a  ‘ normal ’  bulk solution of the same concentration, but containing of course a much 
larger number of molecules (10 18    molecules/L). Clearly, when the number of molecules 
is so small, and moreover the system is  ‘ conﬁ ned ’ , classical views on molecular reactivity 
may require a change in our attitude. For example, in the case of enzymatic reactions, 
one issue is the frequency of collision between a single enzyme and its substrate (which 
may also be another macromolecule present itself in few copies), which might result in 
different reaction rates. It is clear that the chemistry of large numbers breaks down when 
small compartments are considered. Stochastic simulations clearly show the relevance of 
ﬂ uctuations when we move from the continuum regime of Avogadro - like numbers to the 
realm of a few molecules  65,66   Discreteness of matter becomes important in compartmental-
ized reactions, and some unexpected behaviours have already been described (see below). 
 ( ii )  Entrapment of solutes . The discussion on Poisson distribution of previous paragraph 
can be used as starting point for the issue of solutes entrapment. More in particular, we 
may ask whether the Poissonian model, which is based on the hypothesis of independent 
events, apply to real mechanism of vesicle formation and entrapment. When a strong 
interaction between solutes and the membrane is present (e.g., electrostatic or hydropho-
bic one), the answer is of course negative, due to the preferential accumulation (or 
deplenishment) of solutes near the bilayers during the liposome formation. However, the

question may be relevant also in the absence of strong solute/bilayer interaction. An 
analyical discussion is very difﬁ cult in this case, since  –  for example  –  details of liposome 
formation mechanisms are still missing. Lasic, in his monography,  11 classiﬁ es liposome 
formation mechanisms into two broad classes: (1) budding - off, and (2) collapse/closure 
of small bilayer fragments. Entrapment of water - soluble molecules occurs during these 
processes, and therefore further investigations on such dynamics  – at the molecular level 
 –  would be highly useful for a deeper understanding of entrapment mechanism. From the 
empirical viewpoint, however, there are a number of experimental evidences suggesting 
that more intriguing mechanism may bring to  enhanced  entrapment of solutes, caused by 
possibly cooperative effects. 
 We were ﬁ rst interested in this idea and we have carried out a careful evaluation of 
ferritin entrapment in phosphatidylcholine vesicles.  56,57,67 Ferritin is an iron - rich protein 
that can be easily visualized by electronmicroscopy, so that the composition of each vesi-
cles can be simply obtained by visual inspection of microscopic images. The analysis of 
thousand vesicles leads to the unexpected observation that the numerical distribution of 
ferritin molecules inside vesicles signiﬁ cantly diverges from theoretical one (Poisson 
model). Figure  17.6 B shows a typical result. More recently, Yomo and co - workers  68 
reported that in some condition of liposome formation, genetic material (in form of 
plasmid) may be found inside liposomes in an amount higher than expected; and a 
recent report by Keating  69   suggests that molecular crowding may favour super - entrapment 
inside GVs. 
 A very interesting case, not yet fully clariﬁ ed, concerns the simultaneous entrapment 
of several ( > 80) macromolecular compounds (the whole transcription - translation machin-
ery) inside submicrometric lipid vesicles (radius  ∼ 100  nm). 30   In fact, under the conditions 
of the experiment, the Poisson probability to ﬁ nd a small vesicles containing more 
than 80 different compounds is 10  − 26 , i.e., critically close to zero. However, the experi-
mental results indicate a low but well measurable yield of protein produced by the 
entrapped molecular machinery. Now, the calculated cumulative probability for the 
entrapment of  ca . 80 molecules in a vesicle should be the product of 80 independent 
 Figure 17.6   Entrapment statistics. (A) A Poisson distribution may be used to describe the 
number of solutes entrapped into liposomes. Here it is reported the distribution of a solute 
which is expected to be ﬁ nd on average as 0.5 molecule/vesicle. Notice that there is 
about 10% probability of ﬁ nding  more than two solute molecule inside the vesicle. 
(B) Comparison between calculated and experimental distribution of a water - soluble 
marker (ferritin) inside POPC vesicles. Detailed data analysis shows that in some cases

of all macromolecular components of transcription - translation kit inside lipid vesicles of a

The curve (a) indicates the probability of entrapping at least one copy of each molecular 
specie inside the same vesicle. The curve (b) indicates the probability of entrapping at 
least one copy of each molecular species under the hypothesis that their concentrations 
are all 50 times higher than the nominal (bulk) concentrations.  Adapted from Souza  et al 30

Poissonian distribution, and should be size - dependent, as shown in Figure  17.6 C, curve 
a. Large vesicles, in fact, may contain all required ingredients (and be therefore func-
tional), whereas small ones are expected to be not functional. Since the experimental 
results clash with theoretical predictions, a possible physical explanation suggests that 
local (internal) enzymes and ribosomes concentrations are enhanced by a factor  > 10 
(Figure  17.6 C, curve b). Further studies are in progress in order to clarify the nature of 
such effect. 
 ( iii )  Reactivity inside compartments . What are the characteristics of the reactivity 
inside compartments? Can this reactivity be simply the reﬂ ection of the enormous body 
of  in vitro biochemical data? To date, it is not possible to give a clear answer to this 
question, since, as evident from the above - mentioned discussion, we still miss a theoreti-
cal understanding of the compartmentalized systems, and in particular of the effect 
deriving from their small size. In this respect, recently some interesting effects have 
been described, such as the enhanced protein synthesis rate (2 ×  in the ﬁ rst 3 hours) in 
GVs, 70   or the enhanced ﬁ lament assembly based on DNA - protein association rate.  40 In 
the case of protein synthesis in small vesicles (radius  ∼ 100   nm), it has been reported 
that the inner yield is about 6 times the yield of the same reaction in the bulk.  30 These 
deviations from expected results may perhaps derive from molecular crowding and/or 
in vitro conﬁ nement effects, as also suggested by reports on gene expression in moder-
ately crowded model systems (gene brushes),  71   or enhanced protein association in PEG -
 based crowded environments, based on depletion forces.  72   In addition to these effects, 
that may be ascribed to the nature of entrapped solution, it has been also reported that 
lipid itself (surface effects?) may enhance (1.6 × ) the  in vitro  gene expression.  73 Although 
not discussed from the theoretical viewpoint, all these reports indicate a possible exist-
ence of a speciﬁ c effect deriving from conﬁ nement and/or crowding. Interestingly, as 
discussed at the point ( ii ) of this paragraph, enhanced entrapment may also be an outcome 
of liposome formation and entrapment, at least in some cases. A very complex (yet 
fascinating) scenario may emerge from these new studies on compartmentalized system. 
Such intriguing scenario may change our view of reactions in small compartments, and, 
more in general, of cellular biochemistry. We therefore believe that the next generation 
of studies in microcompartmentalized systems must take into account the combined 
effects of single - molecule reactivity, conﬁ nement, molecular crowding, excluded volume, 
and molecular correlation, as well as not - well investigated proteins (or nucleic acids)/
membrane interactions. 
 17.4  A Theoretical Framework for Complex Reactions in Liposomes 
 After the technical excursus presented in the last paragraphs, we now turn back to impor-
tant microcompartmentalized biochemical reactions, in particular those relevant for con-
structing cell models. The reader interested in a more detailed discussion may refer to 
recently published reviews 7,74 
 The research on biochemical reactions inside vesicles has at least three genealogical 
lines. The ﬁ rst is related to origins of life studies, where vesicles (in particular fatty acid 
vesicles) are taken as model of primitive cells. In this studies, vesicles are  per se interest-
ing, since their behaviour may reveal interesting pattern that might be at the basis of the

transition from non - living entities to living ones. Moreover, by creating cellular models 
based on biochemical reactions inside vesicles, it is possible to understand the basic 
principles of compartmentalized systems, and again get insights into the roots of cellular 
life. The second genealogical line, which is also somehow related to the ﬁ rst, is more 
general and deals with the need of realizing (bio)chemical autopoietic systems. Autopoiesis 
(from Greek  ‘ auto ’ : self;  ‘ poiesis ’ : creation, production) describe the nature of life as 
 ‘ self - producing ’  systems, also endowed of basic cognition processes. Autopoietic theory 
was developed by the two Chilean neurobiologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco 
Varela in the Seventies, as a theory that aims to describe life emphasizing the very organi-
zation of its processes, i.e., the organizational invariance despite the continuous building 
and destruction of its structural parts; and the concept of autonomy.  75 – 78 With the realiza-
tion of surfactant - based autopoietic chemical systems, mainly by us in the early 
Nineties, 79 – 81   the concept of creating an autopoietic minimal cell  7,74,82,83   started to attract 
the interest of several research group, although in a diversiﬁ ed way. The third line is more 
modern, and deals with the new and broad research avenue that is called synthetic biology. 
By this constructive approach, scientists tries to understand biological  systems  by building 
them instead of analyzing them. Today, we are witnessing a great interest in synthetic 
biology, perhaps due to its biotechnological promises, but we also think that the new 
constructive view can be useful for basic science and for pure understanding of living 
principles. 
 Let us start the discussion from a theoretical perspective, i.e., the autopoietic system, 
displayed in Figure  17.7 a. Here, a general autopoietic system is represented by a circle, 
the components A being the constituents of autopoietic system. The autopoietic system 
is characterized by an  ‘ inside ’ and an  ‘ outside ’ , and these two worlds are separated by a 
boundary, which is itself generated from the autopoietic system (generation from within). 
Thanks to its inner organization (not shown), the autopoietic system can process X, 
present outside initially, but that can enter the autopoietic unit, so that new A is produced, 
becoming a new part of the autopoietic organization. This ﬁ rst step correspond to genera-
tion of autopoietic component from within. In addition to this route, A can be removed 
from the autopoietic system (A being transformed into W); this second transformation 
correspond to decay of autopoietic components into non - autopoietic ones. It is remarkable 
that notwithstanding with these two opposite routes, the autopoietic unit  –  and, more 
importantly, its organization, is conserved. When the two routes are also balanced, we 
can speak of homeostasis. Clearly, when one of the two routes prevails, growth or decay 
of the autopoietic unit is foreseeable. Moreover, it is clear that the autopoietic system 
interacts with its environment. Undoubtedly, the autopoietic unit describes how living 
cells work. But, thanks to this description, it allows to deﬁ ne what are the minimal func-
tions a living cell must have in order to be recognized as alive (for a recent discussion 
on autopoiesis as necessary and sufﬁ cient  –  or not sufﬁ cient  –  condition for life, see Bitbol 
and Luisi  78  ). It follows that it is a system that  ‘ (1) builds its own boundaries, in a way 
that this construction is due (2) to reaction(s) (activity) taking place within the system, 
and that it is (3) performed through reactions determined by the system itself ’ . 84 Thus, 
such system is autopoietic, and Figure  17.7 a, despite its simplicity, gives a very general 
description of an autopoietic unit. However, in order to translate this description in (bio)
chemical terms, we have to think in molecular terms, and we need a more detailed 
description.

 For example, the X to A transformation of Figure  17.7 a is described without details, 
whereas in chemical terms, several molecular transformations require an additional reac-
tant, and in biology, almost all transformation are catalyzed by enzymes. It follows that 
a slightly more complex description of autopoietic unit is required. In particular, if the X 
to A transformation (Figure  17.7 a) refers to molecular systems, a catalyst C must be 
introduced in the autopoietic organization. Clearly, the catalyst C, being a single mole-
cule,  or a network of processes carried out by several molecules , must also be the product 
of its own activity, as required by autopoiesis. 
 Figure 17.7   Autopoietic systems and complex biochemical reactions in liposomes. 
( a ) The general scheme for an autopoietic system. The autopoietic unit is composed by 
the components A, which constitute the autopoietic unit, boundary included. The external 
component X is incorporated within the autopoietic unit, transformed into an autopoietic 
element A, which takes now part within the autopoietic organization. According to a 
decay process, some autopoietic elements A are transformed into W, which does not take 
part to the autopoietic organization. The autopoietic system has a boundary that 
discriminates between the unit and the environment. However, thanks to the above 
mentioned interactions, the autopoietic unit interacts with the environment. ( b ) A more 
speciﬁ c autopoietic design based on surfactant self - assembled structures. The boundary -
 forming molecular component L is generated by internal transformations starting from a 
precursor X by means of an internal catalyst or catalytic network C. The subsystem C is 
also self - reproducing, by transforming building blocks Y into C, whereas Z ones are 
discarded. A decay reaction also consumes L to give W. This general scheme also 
describes the cell metabolism in an homeostatic state. (c) Some important 
biopolymerization reactions which are implemented in minimal cell models, also based on 
autopoiesis: I. formation of membrane from lipid precursors (a sort of non - covalent 
polymerization); II. formation of RNA from nucleotides (generally indicated as NTPs); III. 
formation of DNA from deoxynucleotides (indicated as dNTPs); IV: formation of proteins 
from amino acids (AAs). These four reactions have been already implemented inside lipid 
vesicles, see also Table  17.1

 In Figure  17.7 b we represent an autopoietic unit composed by boundary - forming mol-
ecules L and by a catalytic system C. The precursor(s) X are now transformed into L 
molecules thanks to the catalytic activity of C, which is also reproducing itself by uptak-
ing the precursor(s) Y. Notice that all component of the systems (L and C) are produced 
from within, the systems is self - bounded, and its behaviour is determined by internal laws. 
Therefore the system in Figure  17.7 b is autopoietic. Also in this case, this system interacts 
with the environment by taking up building blocks (X and Y) and releasing waste products 
(W and Z). 
 Thanks to autopoiesis, we can deﬁ ne minimal functions, implemented them in a syn-
thetic construct, and study the behaviour of such system. Clearly, the system depicted in 
Figure  17.7 b can be realized at different complexity levels, also depending on the chemi-
cal nature of the components. Living cells are autopoietic systems where L are of course 
the lipids (and proteins) constituting the boundary, whereas C is the  whole metabolism 
(including genetic material), that produce itself and the boundary. 
 In recent years, after the achievement of simple chemical autopoietic systems based on 
surfactant self - assemblies 79 – 81   there has been an increasing interest in achieving the ﬁ rst 
minimal cell by implementing biochemical reactions inside vesicles. Such reactions have 
as ﬁ nal goal the synthesis of an autopoietic molecular system as that one represented in 
Figure  17.7 b, although by stepwise advancements. To this aim, several groups started to 
carry out molecular biology reactions inside vesicles, in particular simple enzymatic reac-
tions  –  which will be not discussed here  –  and polymerization reactions (Figure  17.7 c). 
The latter ones have great relevance since (1) all functional biological molecules (proteins, 
RNA, DNA) are biopolymers (the membrane itself can be considered a non - covalent lipid 
polymer); (2) polymerization reactions have also a key role in origins of life studies, since 
they make possible the emergence of ﬁ rst catalysts (such as ribozymes, or the ﬁ rst cata-
lytic peptides) out from small molecules. Notice here that the term polymers is restrictive, 
as enzymes and nucleic acids are actually co - polymers, being formed by several different 
co - monomers. The synthesis of copolymers, and particularly of multiple identical copies 
of ordered sequences, is a very complex problem, and one which is not yet solved in the 
origin of life ﬁ eld - nor experimentally or theoretically. 
 Going back to the question of autopoiesis, Figure  17.7 c also indicates possible  experi-
mental  schemes (indicated as type I to IV systems), and although their implementation 
may be very difﬁ cult, there is no doubt that the interest of the scientiﬁ c community in 
this kind of approaches is continuously growing. We are, however, still far from the 
achievement of a synthetic autopoietic cell, and the current research is addressing the 
basic properties of compartmentalized reactions. In the following, we would like to 
comment in details some relevant cases of the four systems listed in Figure  17.7 c. A full 
list, with short comments, is given in Table  17.1 .
