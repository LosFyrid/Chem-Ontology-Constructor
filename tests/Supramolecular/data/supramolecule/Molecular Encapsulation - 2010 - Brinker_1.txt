 Preface 
  The inclusion of small guest molecules within suitable host compounds results in con-
strained systems that imbue novel properties upon the incarcerated organic substrates. For 
example, the chromophoric nature of dye molecules is considerably altered upon com-
plexation. And the targeted delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients can be facili-
tated  in vivo . So, understandably, supramolecular tactics are becoming widely employed 
and this treatise spotlights them. Indeed, the knowledge gleaned from constructing such 
assemblies can be applied to develop innovative molecular devices. Insofar as molecular 
constraint inﬂ uences chemical reactivity, including chemo - , regio - , and stereoselectivity, 
new synthetic routes become plausible. Often, the impact of encapsulation on product 
formation is substantial. Therefore, special attention must be paid to the stabilization and 
chemistry of short - lived, high - energy intermediates, since they are key compounds that 
govern the outcome of reactions. Common among these transient species is their ability 
to subsequently undergo an array of reaction mechanisms that include the generation of 
unusual or strained products. However, the conventional drawback has been that high 
product yields are sacriﬁ ced due to a lack of selectivity across low - energy barriers. The 
use of a constrained system, however, offers the means to solve this problem by steering 
the reaction trajectory along a desired pathway. In general, we provide a broad overview 
of many different approaches that aim to manipulate chemical reactions. We anticipate 
that this endeavor will be thought provoking and ultimately facilitate the exchange of 
ideas between various scientiﬁ c disciplines. 
 This volume comprises 17 chapters. It is spearheaded by an account of molecular 
recognition being used to precisely control photochemical reactions and foster enantio-
meric excess. The supramolecular reaction proceeds under mild conditions, wherein a 
highly reactive excited - state intermediate readily generates products that are difﬁ cult to 
obtain thermally. Such inductions of enantioselectivity by chiral auxiliary are especially 
appealing. The following three chapters expound upon the cyclodextrin macrocyclic 
hosts, whose wide availability and ability to form inclusion complexes makes them mini-
ature reaction vessels  par excellence . Chapter  2 deals with the use of natural and deriva-
tized Schardinger dextrins to accelerate reactions, such as transesteriﬁ cations and 
Diels – Alder reactions, and to mimic enzymes,  e.g. , ribonucleases and transaminases. 
Chapter  3  focuses on the development of molecular reactors. The primary role of these 
containers is to increase the selectivity of a chemical transformation, which also may 
occur by decreasing the overall rate of the process. In chapter  4 , special cyclodextrin -
 mediated reactions are discussed. Since guest complexation offers the possibility of 
performing organic reactions in aqueous media, microsolvent effects are feasible, the

Preface
protection of water - sensitive intermediates is achieved, and conformational control during 
the reaction is realized. Indeed, this approach has great appeal for environmental chem-
istry. Chapter  5  demonstrates the potential of nanoreactor technology, using zeolites as 
an example. These inorganic inclusion compounds are widely used on an industrial scale 
during petroleum reﬁ ning, for example, because they catalyze the isomerization and 
oligomerization of alkenes. The utility of these materials is due to the presence of active 
sites in well - deﬁ ned cavities that enable customized control of reaction selectivity. And 
though these natural catalysts are readily available, easily reusable, and therefore cost -
 effective, the facile preparation of a container of sufﬁ cient size suitable for the regulation 
of a chemical reaction is an ongoing challenge. To fashion cages as appropriate nano -
 reactors, a novel approach avoiding tedious multistep synthesis is becoming widespread. 
It entails the self - assembly of noncovalent capsules. The results obtained using these 
organized media are highlighted in chapter  6 . 
 Another promising method to augment selectivity is described in chapter  7  and is based 
on the concept of concave reagents whose reactive moiety is situated inside a cleft or 
macrocycle and thereby sterically shielded. Another popular group of hosts used to control 
reactions are the calixarenes (chapter  8 ). Their appeal derives from the ease of the mac-
rocyclic ring - closure during their synthesis and the capability of performing selective 
derivatization to both increase the size of the cavity and introduce functional groups. 
Using this method, a cage can be built wherein the reacting guest is completely imprisoned 
and may only escape at elevated temperatures. These hosts, known as hemicarcerands, 
have allowed isolation and spectroscopic observation of traditionally ephemeral interme-
diates. Remarkable results are presented in chapter  9 . In chapter  10 , an overview is given 
regarding the generation and associated change in reactivity of highly reactive intermedi-
ates, like radicals, carbenes, and nitrenes, within cavitands. This exposition is further 
elaborated by a presentation of the actual developments in dye encapsulation where 
improvements in the photoproperties and chemical stability are especially prized (chapter 
 11 ) and by a description of research on organic cations (chapter  12 ). 
 The subsequent chapters concern methodologies that are not only inspired by biology 
and enzyme mimicry, but actually employ modiﬁ ed biopolymers to achieve catalysis. In 
the ﬁ rst approach, the goal is to improve the enantioselectivity of a classic organometallic 
catalyst through its incorporation into a host protein that generates a secondary coordina-
tion sphere environment responsible for a rise in selectivity. These artiﬁ cial metalloen-
zymes are showcased in chapter  13 . The second technique is summarized in chapter  14  
and details the generation of artiﬁ cial RNA enzymes that are able to catalyze various 
chemical reactions, including the Diels – Alder reaction. 
 Finally, the assembly of more complex systems requires that the exact supramolecular 
reaction site be known. For this purpose, micelles and liposomes are very attractive due 
to the sequestering of reagents, the possibility of conducting various reactions in a con-
ﬁ ned space, and the similarity with living cells. These particular organized media are 
examined in detail in chapter  15 , which describes the catalytic effect of micelles and 
supramolecular systems based on cyclophanes. In addition, the encapsulation process of 
vesicles and their catalytic effect on organic reactions is outlined in chapter  16 . And, 
ﬁ nally, chapter  17 previews efforts to assemble a semi - synthetic cell. 
 Many authors contributed chapters for this book, whose scope covers an expansive 
interdisciplinary area. We are profoundly grateful for their input and expertise. Indeed,

 1.1  Introduction 
 Molecular recognition through non - covalent interactions between two or more molecules 
has attracted much attention from a broad spectrum of chemists for a long period of time 
and has already found many applications in various areas of science and technology. The 
concept of molecular recognition was ﬁ rst developed for biomolecular systems such as 
enzyme, antibody and DNA, which can selectively bind the speciﬁ c target molecules 
through non - covalent weak interactions, including hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, 
dipole – dipole, charge – dipole and hydrophobic interactions. 1 – 3   Recent studies on artiﬁ cial 
host – guest systems have revealed that molecular recognition is the essential conceptual 
basis for supramolecular chemistry and nanotechnology. 4,5 
 Reaction control through complexation of substrate by supramolecular host is a rela-
tively new idea compared to the conventional approaches that involve simple collisional 
attack or coordination of substrate to metal. Multiple non - covalent interactions in supramo-
lecular assembly bind and locate a site - speciﬁ c substrate in the right position, orientation 
and conformation near the catalyst or active site, stabilize the high - energy transition state, 
and eventually make the reaction faster and more selective. Typical examples are found 
in enzymatic reactions, which proceed with high speciﬁ city and efﬁ ciency in aqueous 
solutions under mild conditions. These observations in natural systems have inspired

chemistry and bio - inspired materials science and technology. 6,7 
 Contrary to the thermal counterpart, photochemical reactions in supramolecular system 
have been less investigated and therefore of current interest. Photochemistry is a powerful 
tool in synthetic chemistry as a complementary method for achieving compounds that are 
difﬁ cult to obtain through thermal reactions due to high strain, low stability, and orbital 
symmetry reasons. Unlike thermal reactions, photoreactions deal with excited - state mol-
ecules that are usually short - lived but experience much lower energy barriers and exhibit 
high reactivities even at low temperatures. As a consequence of these features, the precise 
control of a photoreaction is more difﬁ cult to achieve than that of thermal one. This is 
one of the reasons why most asymmetric photoreactions result in only relatively low 
enantioselectivities. In this context, supramolecular approaches to the photochemical 
asymmetric synthesis enable the more precise control of the orientation and conformation 
of substrates and, as a result, the enantioselectivity of photoproducts, by utilizing the 
non - covalent interactions in both ground and excited states. 
 Supramolecular photochemistry is a relatively new interdisciplinary area of science and 
may be tracked back to the work in early 1980s, where the spectroscopic properties of 
ions were manipulated by crown ethers.  8 – 10 The rapid development of supramolecular 
chemistry in the last two decades accelerated the application of supramolecular systems 
to organic photochemistry  11,12   and more recently to asymmetric synthesis,  13,14 leading to 
a great number of publications on reaction control by molecular recognition. Consequently, 
not all of these areas will be covered, but the concentration will be rather on the repre-
sentative supramolecular photoreactions conducted primarily in solution. This will help 
idenitify the crucial concepts, strategies and conclusions as well as the major factors and 
mechanisms that govern the supramolecular photochemistry in different systems, and also 
provide the possible applications and future perspectives of this interesting area of 
supramolecular chemistry. 
 1.2  Photochemical Reactions Mediated by Macrocyclic Compounds 
 1.2.1  Supramolecular Photoreactions with Crown Ethers 
 Crown ethers, a family of cyclic oligomers of ethylene oxide, are artiﬁ cial macrocyclic 
hosts which have been synthesized and utilized since the early days of supramolecular 
chemistry. 15,16   Besides various metal ions that are complexed by crown ethers mainly 
through ion – dipole interaction, primary and secondary organic ammonium ions also form 
stable complexes with larger sized crown ethers through ion – dipole and hydrogen - bond-
ing interactions. Stoddart and co - workers used crown ethers that can simultaneously bind 
two organic ammonium guests to facilitate photodimerization. 17 As illustrated in Scheme 
 1.1 ,  trans - stilbene derivative  2  forms a doubly encircled, doubly threaded 2   :   2 complex 
with bis - p - phenylene - 34 - crown - 10  1  to give a centrosymmetric [4]pseudorotaxane in the 
solid state. In addition to the hydrogen - bonding interactions between  1  and  2 , the complex 
is also stabilized by   π – π stacking interactions between the two  trans - stilbene units with 
mean interplanar and centroid - centroid separations of 3.57 and 4.33    Å , respectively. The 
close arrangement of stilbenes accelerates the photodimerization upon irradiation to

exclusively give a single cyclobutane isomer  4  with a  syn – anti – syn  conformation, as 
conﬁ rmed by X - ray crystallographic analysis. A control experiment showed that no pho-
todimerization but only  trans - to - cis  isomerization took place in the absence of crown 
ether  1 . 
 The photochromic behavior of viologens is greatly affected upon complexion with 
crown ether. Viologens show photoinduced colour change in the absence of any additional 
reagents when dispersed in isotropic thin polymer ﬁ lms. 18   Irradiation of benzylviologen 
 5  (Scheme  1.2 ) incorporated in a polymer matrix caused a colour change from colourless 
to blue as a result of the reduction of  5  from dication to radical cation, which was reverted 
to dication within 2 h in the dark. Crown ether  1  forms a 1   :   1 complex with  5  and also 
with  6 in acetone with association constants of  ca. 200  M  − 1 . The charge - transfer (CT) 
interaction between viologen  5  or  6  and  1  led to the formation of yellow - coloured CT 
complex with a CT absorption band at 453   nm and 421   nm for  5  and  6 , respectively. The 
crown ether complexes of photoreduced viologens showed much accelerated bleaching 
rates than the corresponding free viologen radical cations. A similar phenomenon was 
observed also for  2  ⊂  1 complex in a polymer matrix. 
 1.2.2  Supramolecular Photoreactions with Calixarenes 
 Calix[ n ]arenes are a class of macrocycles that are normally made up of phenol units linked 
with methylene bridges and possess cavities of various sizes that can accommodate small 
organic molecules primarily driven by hydrophobic interactions. 
 Water soluble  p - sulfonatocalix[6]arene (SCA[6]) and [8]arene (SCA[8]) (Scheme  1.3 ) 
have dimensions of 15.9    ×  11.8  Å  and 20.4    ×  16.7  Å  at the upper rim and 6.5    ×  3.3  Å and

8.6  ×  5.9  Å  at the lower rim, respectively,  19,20   and provide suitable cavities for accom-
modating quaternary ammonium ions,  21,22   native amino acids,  23   and small neutral organic 
molecules.  24   Using SCA[6] and SCA[8]  25   as supramolecular hosts, Ramamurthy  et al. 
investigated the photochemistry of benzoin alkyl ethers  7a – c . 26 – 28 These SCAs formed 
the corresponding 1   :   1 complexes with  7a – c  in aqueous solution, and  7a  showed modest 
association constants of 137   M  − 1 and 386  M  − 1  with SCA[6] and SCA[8], respectively. 
Upon photolysis, these benzoin alkyl ethers underwent both the Norrish type I (  α -
 cleavage) and type II (  γ  - hydrogen abstraction) reactions to give photoproducts  8 – 12 
(Scheme  1.3 ). In the absence of SCAs, pinacol ether  9  was obtained as in 92% relative 
yield in aqueous solution at pH 7, along with deoxybenzoin  11  (8% relative yield), 
for which the   α - cleavage ( k  α   ≈  10 10  s  − 1 ) faster than the   γ - hydrogen abstraction ( k  γ   ≈  
10 9  s  − 1 ) is responsible. However, when the photoreaction was performed in the presence 
of SCA, product  11  became the major product. The relative yield of the type II products 
 11 and  12 depends critically on the cavity size of hosts and association constants. 
Photoirradiation of  7a  in the presence of an 8 - fold excess amount of SCA[8] or SCA[6] 
gave  11  and  12  in 96% or 70% combined yield, respectively. The dominant formation of 
type II products suggests that  7  adopts a conformation favourable for   γ - hydrogen absorp-
tion in the cavity. Choosing a suitable substrate with higher binding afﬁ nity for SCA is 
likely to be crucial in improving the stereoselectivity of photoreaction. 
 Photoreaction of stilbazoles  13a – f  (Scheme  1.4 ) has also been investigated in the pres-
ence of SCA[ n ]. Upon irradiation in dilute aqueous HCl solution without a host,  trans -
 stilbazoles  13a – f  gave predominantly  cis - isomers  16a – f , along with only small amounts 
of  anti - head - to - tail  (HT) dimers  14a – f  and  anti - head - to - head  (HH) dimers  15a – f . 29 In 
aqueous solution, stilbazoles were found to form 2   :   1 complexes with SCA[8] and SCA[6], 
irradiation of which afforded the corresponding  anti - HT dimer in 66 – 86% yield in the 
presence of SCA[8] and in 60 – 76% yield in the presence of SCA[6]. The  anti - HH dimer 
was given in only 16% yield, which was attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between 
two pyridinium components. The hydrophobic nature of SCA cavity should be responsi-
ble for the inclusion of stilbazoles. It is thus concluded that SCAs control the orientation 
of stilbazoles through complex formation to eventually enhance the distribution of 
HT dimer.

 Unlike water - soluble calixarenes that encapsulate guests by hydrophobic, electrostatic 
and van der Waals interactions, amphiphilic calixarenes in solid state form container -  or 
capsule - like structures and include guest molecules predominantly through van der Waals 
interactions. Photochemical behavior of stilbenes included in amphiphilic molecular cap-
sules of  p - hexanoylcalix[4]arene  19  (Scheme  1.5 ) in the solid state was studied by 
Ananchenko  et al. 30   Possessing diverse uni -  and bimolecular reaction routes, including 
geometrical isomerization, cyclization and cyclodimerization, stilbenes are good model 
compounds for examining the effects of calixarene capsules on photoreactivity. In the 
solid state, two molecules of  19 self - assemble in a head - to - head fashion to form a hydro-
phobic capsule, which can accommodate two  cis - stilbene molecules to give a 2  :  2 complex. 
This 2   :   2 complex is not very stable and can release one  cis - stilbene molecule. On the 
other hand,  trans - stilbene  20  is co - included with an ethanol molecule in the capsule to 
give a 1   :   1   :   2 complex. Irradiation of the complex of  cis - stilbene ﬁ rst gave rise to  trans -
 stilbene, and then to [2+2] dimers  21  and  22  in 5   :   1 ratio upon prolonged irradiation. 
Irradiation of  trans - stilbene complex gave  cis - and  trans - stilbene in 1  :  1 ratio, along with 
a trace amount of dimers  21  and  22 , conﬁ rming that the initial capsule is occupied pri-
marily by only one  trans - stilbene molecule. 
 Notably, calixarene  19  readily forms solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), which can serve 
as a potential carrier system.  31 2 - Ethylhexyl  trans - 4 - methoxycinnamate  23  can be loaded

[ 19 ]   =   0.6) with that of crystalline complex  23   ⊂  19 2  revealed that the complexation 
pattern of the SLN loaded with  23  is similar to that of the crystalline complex. No dimeri-
zation product was obtained upon irradiation of  23  loaded in SLN of  19 , and only pho-
toisomerization occurred to give a 4   :   6 mixture of  cis - and  trans - isomer. However, when 
the stoichiometry was changed to [ 23 ]/[ 19 ]  =  1.2, photolysis of  23  loaded in SLN yielded 
HH dimers  24  and  25  in a combined yield of  ca.  10%. This regioselectivity of cyclodimer-
ization of  23  is attributed to the fact that two  23  molecules preferably align in the  19 ’ s 
cavity in HH orientation. These results suggest that one can efﬁ ciently manipulate the 
photochemical behavior of  23  by simply adjusting the molar ratio of  23  loaded to the 
SLNs of amphiphilic  19 . 
 1.2.3  Supramolecular Photoreactions with Cyclodextrins 
 Cyclodextrins (CDs) are most frequently employed hosts for supramolecular photoreac-
tions by virtue of the fact that they are readily available, UV - transparent, water - soluble 
and capable of accommodating a wide range of organic guests in their hydrophobic cavi-
ties. Organic guests can form inclusion complexes with   α - ,   β - and   γ - CDs in various stoi-
chiometries both in solution and in the solid state. 
 Unimolecular Reactions    The cavity of   β  - CD is smaller than that of   γ - CD, and normally 
includes one organic molecule of suitable size to form 1  :  1, 2  :  2 or 2  :  1 host – guest com-
plexes. Asymmetric intramolecular  meta - photocycloaddition of phenoxyalkenes (Scheme 
 1.6 ) has been studied in the presence of   β - CD by Eycken and co - workers 32 . The inclusion 
complexes of  26 ,  28 ,  30 and  32 with  β - CD were collected from the deposit formed in a 
warm aqueous solution containing   β  - CD and substrates by centrifugation and decantation. 
For the complexes of  26a ,  28b ,  30a  and  30b  with   β - CD, the host - guest stoichiometries 
were determined as 2   :   1 by UV spectroscopy, while the rest of the substrates formed 1   :   1 
complexes. Irradiation of the solid complexes for 24 h led to  ca. 55 – 82% conversion, 
which are appreciably lower than that obtained in the solution - phase photoreactions. In 
all cases,  meta  - photocycloaddition led exclusively to only one regioisomer of 1,5 - bridged 
dihydrosemibullvalenes  27 ,  31  and  33  respectively from  26 ,  30  and  32 . On the contrary, 
irradiation of complex  28  ⊂    CD afforded two  meta  adducts  29a,b  and  29c,d . The regi-
oselectivity of adducts  29a and  29c is about 1  :  3 in the presence of   β - CD against 1  :  1 in 
the absence of   β - CD. Photocyclization of  ‘ linear ’  photosubstrates  26a,b  gave insigniﬁ cant 
enantiomeric excess (ee) of less than 3%, which is probably due to the less restricted 
orientation of  p - substituted substrate in the cavity. Photocyclization of  28a afforded minor 
product  29a  in much better 17% ee but the major product  29c  in only 2% ee. These results 
may indicate the trade - off relationship between chemical and optical yield: thus, larger 
steric hindrance leads to low chemical but high optical yield, and vice versa.   
 It is well documented that direct or sensitized photolysis of ( Z ) - cyclooctene  34Z leads 
to geometrical isomerization to planar chiral ( E ) - isomer  34E (Scheme  1.7 ). 33   Due to the 
comprehensive work by Inoue  et al. , the enantiodifferentiating photoisomerization of  34Z 
sensitized by optically active benzenecarboxylates has become a benchmark reaction for 
evaluating chiral photosensitizing system.  34 – 36 The ﬁ rst supramolecular enantiodifferenti-
ating photoisomerization of  34Z  was examined in direct photolysis of its   β - CD complex

in the solid state. Photoproduct obtained from this complex was almost racemic with only 
0.24% ee, demonstrating that the cavity interior of native   β  - CD does not possess sufﬁ cient 
enantiodifferentiating ability for the photoisomerization of  34Z . 
 A more sophisticated strategy for achieving higher levels of enantiodifferentiation has 
been established by performing the photolysis of  34Z  with sensitizing chiral hosts  35 
(Scheme  1.7 ), in which a chromophore is introduced to the primary rim of   β - CD. A clear 
merit of this supramolecular photosensitization system is that the energy of excited sen-
sitizer can be efﬁ ciently transferred to  34Z  included in CD cavity, while the undesirable, 
less - enantiodifferentiating sensitization outside the CD cavity can be prevented. 
Furthermore, this sensitizing host strategy allows the asymmetric photoreaction to 
occur with only a catalytic amount of chiral host, achieving photochemical chirality 
ampliﬁ cation. 
 In contrast to the small  E / Z  ratios around 0.25 reported for non - supramolecular 
photosensitizations by conventional alkyl benzoates,  37 an  E / Z  ratio of up to 0.8 were 
obtained at the photostationary state in 1   :   1 methanol – water mixture by using  35 . By 
adjusting the solvent composition, good enantiomeric excesses of up to 24% were 
obtained upon photosensitization with  35a – d . The enantioselectivity of  34E obtained 
in the photoisomerization of  34Z  with non - methylated CD is in general insensitive to 
the temperature variations as a result of the insigniﬁ cant role of entropy in the   β - 
CD - based supramolecular photochirogenesis system. However, the photoisomerization 
of  34Z  in permethylated CD derivatives  35e – h  turned out to be highly temperature 
dependent, frequently leading to a switching of the product chirality by changing the 
reaction temperature.  38 The more ﬂ exible skeleton of permethylated CD due to the lack 
of hydrogen - bonding net at the secondary rim is responsible for the temperature - depend-
ent enantioselectivity. 
 Recently, further efforts were done to elucidate the effects of chromophore substitution 
on the ee of  34E , 39   and much better enantiomeric excesses of up to 46% were reported 
upon photosensitized isomerization mediated by  35m . Analogous hosts  35a ,  35l  and  35n 
afforded only modest ee ’ s in a range of 4% – 10% under optimized conditions.  40 The ee 
value falls drastically to 1.7% when the  meta  - substituent is altered from methoxy ( 35m ) 
to methyl in  35j . This result reveals the critical dependence of the efﬁ ciency of chirality 
transfer on the sensitizer structure in the supramolecular photosensitized isomerization 
system. 
 Bimolecular Reactions    β  - CD is known to hinder the [2+2] photodimerization of stil-
benes through complexation within its cavity.  41   In contrast,   γ - CD can simultaneously 
include two stilbenes in its larger cavity in both solution and solid phase to signiﬁ cantly 
facilitate the [2+2] photodimerization reaction. 
 Wenz and co - workers examined the complexation and photochemical behavior of 
water - soluble stilbene  36g  with   γ - CD in aqueous solution. 41   γ - CD forms 1  :  2 host – guest 
complex with  36g  in buffer solution (pH 5.7) at 25    ° C with stepwise association constants 
of K 1  =  385  M  − 1  and K 2  =  2730  M  − 1 . Photoirradiation of this ternary complex gave 
cyclobutanes  cis - 37g  in 19% and  trans - 39g  in 79% relative yield. The association con-
stants of adducts  37g  and  39g  with   γ - CD were K  37g  ⊂ γ - CD  =  520  M  − 1  and K  39g  ⊂ γ - CD  =  18000  M  − 1 , 
respectively, revealing a great difference in stability between the isomeric complexes of 
[ 36g ] 2  ⊂  γ - CD.

 The inclusion complexes of  36a – f  with   γ  - CD were prepared by the co - crystallization 
method. 42   The host/guest ratio varies from 1   :   1.60 to 1   :   1.95, indicating that most of the 
guests formed 1  :  2 host – guest complexes. However, the  cis - isomer  41a gave only 1  :  1 
complex with   γ  - CD under the same condition. Photolysis of  36  ⊂   γ  - CD for 24 h gave 
 syn - dimers  37a – f  and  38a – f  in 59 - 79% relative yield. This observation is in sharp contrast 
to the results obtained in the solution - phase photolysis of  37g  mentioned above, and is 
attributed to the rate - limiting diffusion process prior to the reaction. The large distance 
and nonparallel orientation of the oleﬁ nic double bonds of the stilbenes in crystal lattices 
prohibit the dimerization of  anti - isomers. 
 Tamaki  et al.  reported that water - soluble anthracene derivatives, such as 2 - anthrace-
nesulfonate and 2 - anthracenecarboxylate, form 2   :   1 complexes with   γ - CD in aqueous 
solution. 43,44 The [4+4] photodimerization of 2 - anthracenecarboxylate (AC) accommo-
dated in   γ  - CD and its derivatives was investigated in detail.  45 Inoue and co - workers 
have recently reinvestigated the photodimerization of AC from the chiral point of view 
by using a variety of chiral hosts.   γ - CD forms very stable 1  :  2 host - guest complex with 
AC in aqueous buffer solution with association constants of K 1  =  160  M  − 1 and 
K 2  =  38500  M  − 1 . 46 
 Photolysis of AC gives four isomeric cyclodimers:  anti - and  syn - HT dimers  43  and  44 
and  anti - and  syn - HH dimers  45  and  46 , of which  44  and  45  are chiral (Scheme  1.9 ). 
Irradiation of   γ - CD complex of AC at 0  ° C gives the HT dimers  43  and  44  as major 
products in 88% combined yield and HH dimers  45  and  46  as minor products in 12% 
yield. HT dimer  44  is given in a moderate enantioselectivity of 37% ee, while poor enan-
tioselectivity of less than 5% ee is given for HH dimer  45 . 
 Further efforts to improve the HT/HH and enantioselectivity of the photoreaction were 
carried out by using modiﬁ ed   γ - CDs. Ikeda  et al.  reported that, by using dipyridinio -
 appended   γ - CDs  49a – d  (Scheme  1.10 ) as chiral hosts,  45  is given in enhanced ee of 13%, 
which is signiﬁ cantly higher than that obtained with native   γ - CD. 47

 γ - CD derivative  47  that tethered with a ﬂ exible dicationic sidearm on the primary rim 
was also employed for the purpose to improve the chemical and optical yield of HH 
dimers. 48   In aqueous solution, photoirradiation of AC with  47  gave the cyclodimers in 
relative yield and ee similar to those obtained with native   γ - CD. However, when the 
photoreaction was performed in a 1   :   1 mixture of water/methanol at  − 45  ° C, the chemical 
yield of HH dimers was dramatically enhanced to 72% with ee of  45  being signiﬁ cantly 
improved to 40%. The  anti / syn ( 45 / 46 ) ratio of HH dimers obtained in the photocy-
clodimerization of AC mediated by regioisomeric 6A,6X - diamino -  γ - CDs  48a – d gradually 
increased with increasing distance between the two ammonium groups, showing a nice 
structure – function relationship in supramolecular chirogenesis system.  49 Furthermore, a 
series of secondary - rim - substituted and skeleton - modiﬁ ed   γ - CDs  51 – 56  were synthesized 
in order to examine the effect of modiﬁ cation of CD skeleton on the photocyclodimeriza-
tion of AC.  50   The ee of HT dimer  44  was enhanced up to 71% and the combined yield of 
HT dimers reached 93% by the use of  54 at 210  MPa and  − 21.5  ° C. 
 Recently, the effects of ﬂ exible and rigid caps introduced to the primary rim of   γ - CD 
( 50a – d ,  57a – c ) on the photodimerization of AC were investigated, as capping is known 
to signiﬁ cantly modify the binding and reaction behavior of native CDs.  51,52 The chemical

yield and ee of HH dimer  45  were considerably improved by using capped   γ - CDs  57a – c . 
The enantioselectivity of HT dimer  44  was found to critically rely on the rigidity of the 
capping moiety. Thus, ﬂ exibly capped   γ - CD  50a  afforded  44  in moderate ee around 40%, 
whereas   γ - CD  57c that has a rigid biphenyl cap gave the antipodal  44 in 58% ee. 
 The main motif in the photocyclodimerization of AC mentioned above is to enhance 
the HT/HH and enantioselectivity through modiﬁ cation of   γ  - CD to provide an optimized 
microenvironment. An interesting approach has recently been explored to inﬂ uence the 
photoreaction inside a host by manipulating the moiety existing outside the cavity.  53 
Instead of directly using AC as substrate, 6 -  O - (2 - anthracenecarbonyl) -  α - CD  58 was 
employed as a photosubstrate that possesses a bulky   α  - CD to be located outside the host 
cavity upon complexation. Two anthracene moieties of  58  can be included in   γ - CD cavity 
to give the stepwise 1   :   1 and 1   :   2 association constants of 270 and 21700   M  − 1 , respectively. 
Photoirradiation of  58  yielded dimerization products  59 – 62  in the absence of host, which 
were hydrolyzed in alkaline solution to give  43 – 46  for evaluating the yield and enanti-
oselectivity. Direct irradiation of  58  gave HT dimers in 76% combined yield, with low 
ee ’ s for both HT dimer  44  (5% ee) and HH dimer  45  (16% ee). Photoirradiation of  58 in 
the presence of   γ - CD afforded   α - CD - stopped rotaxanes  63  and  64  in a high combined 
yield of 98%. Furthermore, the ee of HT dimer  44  was greatly enhanced to 91% under a 
pressure of 210   MPa at  − 20  ° C, suggesting that the   α  - CD that locates outside the   γ - CD

cavity can critically affect the stereo -  and enantioselectivity of the [4   +   4] photocy-
clodimerization of AC occurring inside the cavity. 
 1.2.4  Supramolecular Photoreactions with Cucurbiturils 
 Cucurbit[ n ]urils (CB[ n ]s) are a family of macrocyclic compounds comprising 5 – 10 gly-
coluril units. CB[6], CB[7] and CB[8] are similar in cavity volume to   α - CD,   β - CD and 
 γ  - CD, respectively. Differing from CDs, CBs are achiral host molecules of D nh symmetry 
and therefore cannot provide chiral microenvironment. 
 Although the solubility of CB[7] in water is the highest in the CB family, the relative 
small cavity, compared to that of CB[8], appears to have limited its application as a tem-
plate in photochemistry. Up to now, only one work on [4   +   4] photodimerization of a 
small cationic guest, i.e. protonated 2 - aminopyridine  65  (Scheme  1.12 ), by CB[7] in 
aqueous solution has been reported by Macartney and co - workers.  54 The [4  +  4] photo-
dimerization of  65  in acidic aqueous solution in the absence of CB[7] gave  anti - and 
 syn - trans - 4,8 - diamino - 3,7 - diazatricyclo[4.2.2.2] - dodeca - 3,7,9,11 - tetraenes  66 and  67 in 
4   :   1 ratio. CB[7] can form complex with  65 in 1  :  1 and 2  :  1 stoichiometries, depending 
on the amount of  65  added. Irradiation of 2   :   1 complex showed a greatly improved reac-
tion rate and gave exclusively  anti - trans - 66  in 90% yield without accompanying any other 
products. Such a high stereoselectivity suggests that two  65  molecules in an  anti - trans 
alignment are stabilized in CB[7] cavity. Interestingly, the inclusion of photoproduct  66 
in the CB[7] cavity efﬁ ciently prohibits its thermal re - aromatization. 
 Kim  et al.  reported that CB[8] could accommodate two aromatic guest molecules to 
form 1  :  2 host - guest complexes or 1  :  1  :  1 ternary complexes. The solubility of CB[8] is 
quite poor in water and organic solvents. Fortunately, by adding some metal cations, the 
solubility of CB[8] could be considerably increased in water. This observation enabled 
scientists to investigate intermolecular photoreactions in CB[8] cavity. 
 Stilbene and its derivatives, which had been widely investigated in CDs and CAs, can 
be included in CB[8] cavity to form 2   :   1 complexes.  55 Two ( E ) - diaminostilbene dihydro-
chloride  68  (Scheme  1.13 ) can insert into CB[8] cavity to give a 2   :   1 host - guest complex 
which has a good solubility in water. Photoirradiation of the complex gave [2+2] photo-
dimerization product 1  α ,2 α ,3 β ,4 β - tetrakis(4 - aminophenyl)cyclobutane  69  as major 
product, along with a trace amount of 1  α ,2 β ,3 α ,4 β - tetrakis(4 - aminophenyl)cyclobutane 
 70 . No formation of the isomerization product ( Z ) - 68  was observed, which is signiﬁ cantly 
different from the photoreaction of ( E ) - 68  in the absence of CB[8]. The stereoselectivity 
of photodimerization in the presence of CB[8] ( syn / anti    =   95/5) is much better than that 
obtained with  γ - CD ( syn / anti  =  80/20).

 Irradiation of  trans - 1,2 - bis(4 - pyridyl)ethylene dihydrochloride in the presence of 
CB[8] also yields the  syn  - dimer as major product in 90% relative yield and  anti - dimer in 
only 4% relative yield.  56   However, in the presence of CB[7], no [2+2] dimerization 
product was obtained and only  cis - 1,2 - bis(4 - pyridyl)ethylene was formed. This result is 
attributed to the different complexation stoichiometry of 1,2 - bis(4 - pyridyl)ethylene with 
CB[7] (1  :  1) and CB[8] (2  :  1). 
 Recently, photodimerization of unsymmetrical bispyridylethylenes  71  was investigated 
in the cavity of CB[8].  57   Irradiation of  71  in the absence of CB[8] gave no [2+2] photo-
dimer, and only  trans - to - cis  isomerization is observed for the photoreaction in the pres-
ence of CB[7]. Interestingly, irradiation of  71  with CB[8] gave exclusively  anti - HT  74 
and  syn - HH  72  dimers in 80% and 15% relative yield, respectively, among four possible 
[2+2] dimers of  syn - HH  72 ,  syn - HT  73 ,  anti - HT  74 and  anti - HH  75 . 
 Wu  et al.  investigated the photodimerization of alkyl 2 - naphthoates  76a,b (Scheme 
 1.14 ) in the presence of CB[8].  58   The solubility of  76a,b  in water was enhanced upon 
addition of CB[8]. As a result of 1   :   2 host – guest complexation between CB[8] and  76 , 
photodimerization reaction rate was greatly accelerated in aqueous solution to give 
cubane - like photodimers  77a,b . 
 Inoue and co - workers also examined the [4+4] photocyclodimerization of   α - CD 
appended anthracene derivative  58  mediated by CB[8] (Scheme  1.11 ).  58 Photodimerization

of AC using CB[8] as template gave photodimers in relative yields similar to those 
obtained in the absence of CB[8]. However, the use of CB[8] as a host for the photo-
dimerization of  58  totally inverted the selectivity observed with   γ  - CD to give HH dimers 
 45  and  46  in 99% combined yield. The steric repulsion between two   α - CD does not appear 
to play an important role in the determination of the HH/HT ratio but signiﬁ cantly affects 
the  anti / syn  ratio of HH dimers, revealing a dual role of the bulky   α - CD in the stereodif-
ferentiation step of the supramolecular photodimerization. On the other hand,   α - CD 
located outside the cavity could even transfer its chiral information to the photodimeriza-
tion occurring within the achiral cavity of CB[8] to yield  44  and  45  in modest 17% and 
10% ee, respectively. 
 Large - sized host molecules derived from calixarene and cyclotriveratrylenes have been 
reported recently. Gibb and co - workers reported some nanoscale host molecules based 
on resorcinarenes and studied their shape complementarities and the complexation behav-
ior with guest molecules.  59 – 61 Host  78  (Scheme  1.15 ), which provides a well - deﬁ ned 
hydrophobic environment in water, forms a capsular complex [ 78 ] 2  with a cavity dimen-
sion of 1   nm wide and 2   nm long.  59 Ramamurthy  et al.  examined the cage effect of host 
[ 78 ] 2 on the photoreaction of 1 - phenyl - 3 - p - tolyl - 2 - propanone, 62 which exhibit signiﬁ cant 
cage effect comparable to that reported in the solid state. 63,64 
 This host molecule can also form 2   :   2 complex with anthracene (Scheme  1.15 )  65 . 
However, no anthracene dimer was observed even after 10 h irradiation of the complex.

Steady - state ﬂ uorescence spectrum of anthracene without  78  was completely different 
from that in the presence of  78 . Thus, anthracene in aqueous solution showed only 
monomer ﬂ uorescence at 425   nm, but the complex with [ 78 ] 2  exhibited excimer emission 
of anthracene with a maximum at 510   nm and a long lifetime of 263   ns. This suggests that 
the capsule [ 78 ] 2 conﬁ nes two anthracene molecules in its cavity in staggered orientation. 
 Similar to anthracene, acenaphthylene can also be encapsulated by [ 78 ] 2 to form a 2  :  2 
complex. 66   NMR studies suggested that two acenaphthylene molecules are located in the 
middle of the capsule cavity and oriented in a parallel fashion. Irradiation of acenaphth-
ylene in the absence of any host yielded  syn - and  anti  - dimers, with the latter being the 
major product. Within the [ 78 ] 2  cavity, only  syn - dimer  79  was obtained upon irradiation. 
In the presence of triplet sensitizer eosin - Y, irradiation of the complex gave  syn - and 
 anti - dimers in a ratio 60  :  40. 
 Oleﬁ ns were also examined as guest substrates for this nanocapsule. 67   In borate buffer 
solution,  trans - and  cis - 4,4 ′ - dimethylstilbene  81a formed 1  :  2 complex with [ 78 ] 2 . 
Irradiation of  trans - 81a  ⊂  [ 78 ] 2  led to very slow isomerization, while  cis - 81a  ⊂  [ 78 ] 2 
converted to  trans  - isomer very fast. For stilbene  81b  with a smaller size, the  trans - to - cis 
isomerization became much easier and was almost unaffected by the capsule. Furthermore, 
4 - methylstyrene  83 , which has a half size of  81a , was irradiated in the capsule to explore 
its photochemical behavior. 4 - Methylstyrene  83 forms 2  :  2 complex with  78 . Irradiation 
of this complex afforded  84 and  85 in 45% and 55% relative yield, respectively. 
 1.3  Photochemical Reactions with Biomolecules 
 Biomolecules, such as protein, antibody and DNA, are macromolecules that possess 
binding sites for organic guests with well - deﬁ ned three - dimensional geometries and pre-
cisely arranged functional groups. As a result of their structural properties, biomolecules 
are characterized by the signiﬁ cant speciﬁ city for complexing and catalyzing their sub-
strates. For example, it is well known that enzyme can accelerate the reaction of its 
substrate by a factor of one million or even more compared to the control reaction in the 
absence of enzyme. Their binding sites are highly speciﬁ c to substrates and can usually 
catalyze a set of closely related substrates or reactions, but are silent to those mismatched. 
Since most biomolecules are water - soluble and heat - sensitive, performing a reaction with 
biomolecules deﬁ nitely means the use of mild and environmentally benign conditions. 
On the other hand, light energy is known to be environmentally benign and can be efﬁ -
ciently converted into chemical energy through biophotochemical process, such as pho-
tosynthesis. These properties are superior in many aspects to those of artiﬁ cial hosts and 
have attracted chemists to pursue efﬁ cient and selective chemical reactions in binding 
sites of biomolecules. 
 1.3.1  Photochemical Reactions Templated by Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) 
 DNAs are important molecules that carry the genetic information and are capable of self -
 replication in living organism. The basic unit of DNA is nucleotide that comprises of a 
nucleobase (adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine), deoxyribose, and a phosphate tail 
(Scheme  1.16 ). The precise complementarity between adenine and thymine and between 
cytosine and guanine renders two long chains of nucleotides coiled to give rise to a twisted

double helix, which is driven predominantly by hydrogen bonding and   π  π stacking 
interactions. It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that the DNA chain itself can serve 
as a good template for precisely positioning the substrates linked to it. 
 Photoaddition of substrates covalently - linked to DNA at its terminus has been studied 
for the purpose of exploring photoinduced ligation of oligonucleotides. Photoligation has 
evident advantages that the ligation can be conducted in water without adding any external 
reagent in a non - enzymatic fashion and the original DNA can be recovered by wave-
length - selective irradiation. 
 Saito and co - workers investigated a series of photoligation reactions of DNA using 
native and terminus - functionalized oligonucleotides.  68 – 76   As illustrated in Scheme  1.17 , 
synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides  88a  and  88b , which bear a cytosine at the 3 ′ - end and a 
5 - vinyldeoxyuridine at the 5 ″ - end, are complementary to an oligodeoxynucleotide tem-

plate  89 . 68 In the absence of  89 , no photoadduct was given upon photoirradiation at 
366   nm, at which  88b  has only weak absorption of   ε 366  =  3.3. However, photoligated 
oligodeoxynucleotide  90  was obtained in up to 96% yield when photolysis was carried 
out for 12 h in the presence of  89 . Only one [2+2] photoadduct that has a  cis - syn stere-
ochemistry was afforded. The signiﬁ cantly enhanced reactivity and selectivity are attrib-
uted to the well - arranged orientation of two oligodeoxynucleotides when complexed with 
the template  89 . Vinyldeoxyuridine introduced at the 5 ′  - end underwent the same [2+2] 
photoaddition with thymine at the 3 ″  - end but not with adenine and guanine. The ligated 
oligodeoxynucleotide can be photodecomposed to give the original 6 - mers upon irradia-
tion at 302   nm but better recovered by further irradiation at 366   nm, suggesting photo-
chemical reversibility of the ligation process.   
 However, the split of ligated DNA with light at 302   nm may also result in damage to 
DNA due to the dimerization of thymine. To avoid this disadvantage, Fujimoto and co -
 workers synthesized 3 ″ - terminus - modiﬁ ed oligodeoxynucleotide  91 (Scheme  1.17 ), in 
which carbazole is tethered to the 5 - carboxyvinyluracil moiety as a sensitizer for photo-
decomposition.  69   Photolysis of oligodeoxynucleotides with a template gave ligated oligo-
deoxynucleotide with an efﬁ ciency order  91c  >  91b  >  91a . A  cis - syn  [2+2] adduct was 
given in 89% yield after the photolysis of  91c  at 366   nm for 6 h at room temperature in 
the presence of the template. The same reaction performed at 70    ° C, where  91c was 
decomplexed from the template, afforded no photoligated product, indicative of the 
importance of preorientation of photosubstrate by supramolecular host. On the other hand, 
photoirradiation of the isolated adduct in the absence of the template at 366   nm for 6 h 
afforded  91c in 90% yield as a result of the photosensitized split. 
 In order to improve the photoreactivity of template - directed photochemical synthesis 
of branched oligodeoxynucleotides, the 5 - vinyldeoxyuridine component was replaced by 
5 - carboxyvinyldeoxyuridine  92 , which has a much higher extinction coefﬁ cient 
( ε 366  =  76). 70   Photoirradiation of  92  for 1 h in the presence of a template gave a  cis - syn 
[2+2] adduct in good yield of 93%. Similar [2+2] photocycloaddition between an   α - 5 -
 cyanovinyldeoxyuridine  93  at the 3 ′  - end and a thymine at the 5 ′ - end also occurred 
smoothly in the presence of a template.  71   A single mismatch in oligodeoxynucleotide 
chain led to a great decrease of reaction rate, indicating a critical dependence of photoli-
gation on sequence speciﬁ city. 
 Using  94  as a template DNA, Ihara  et al.  investigated the photodimerization of anthra-
cene tethered to complementary oligodeoxynucleotides  95  and  96 (Scheme  1.18 ). 77 The 
reactivity of the photodimerization mediated by  94  was found to be dependent on the 
distance between oligodeoxynucleotides and anthracene, and decrease in an order of 
 95a / 96a  >  95a / 95b  >  95b / 96b  >  96a / 96b . The reaction efﬁ ciency is also signiﬁ cantly 
affected by the introduction of an additional or mismatched nucleotide, indicating that 
this DNA - templated photoligation is highly position - and distance - dependent. 
 Photodimerization of 1 - substituted anthracene derivatives  97a  and  97b (Scheme  1.19 ) 
templated by a full - match DNA  98 selectively afforded only two isomeric dimers among 
the eight dimers that are possibly formed from the dimerization of  97a  and  97b . 
Photoreaction with the full - match template was found to be much more efﬁ cient than 
those with mismatch templates. 78,79

and chiral in nature, they can be used as ideal stereodifferentiating binding sites. Inoue 
 et al.  performed the enantiodifferentiating photoisomerization of  34Z (Scheme  1.7 ) com-
plexed and sensitized by calf thymus DNA (ctDNA).  80   Photosensitized isomerization of 
 34Z  with pyrimidine nucleosides as chiral sensitizers afforded  34E  in 5.2% ee at the 
photostationary state. However, much better ee of up to 15.2% was obtained when the 
photolysis was carried out in the presence of ctDNA in aqueous solution. Supramolecular 
interaction of  34Z  with hydrophobic minor groove of ctDNA evidently plays an important 
role in the photochirogenesis, as only negligible ee was obtained for  34E  when the pho-
tosensitization was performed in 50% aqueous methanol, in which the supramolecular 
interaction of  34E with ctDNA was signiﬁ cantly reduced.

 covalent interactions, such as ionic, hydrogen binding, van der Waals and hydrophobic 
interaction, these biopolymers fold into speciﬁ c conformations to achieve various biologi-
cal functions. The binding sites of deﬁ ned shape and size, as well as the chiral nature, 
render proteins excellent supramolecular hosts for speciﬁ c binding and recognition. A 
series of photochemical reactions have been investigated with various proteins, mainly 
targeting the photochemical chiral discrimination and generation based on the inherently 
chiral character of binding sites in protein. Serum albumin is the most abundant protein 
in plasma which binds and transports not only endogenous but also exogenous com-
pounds, and has therefore been most frequently employed as biosupramolecular host for 
photochemical reactions. 
 McDonagh and co - workers investigated the photoisomerization of bilirubin - IIIa  99a,b 
(Scheme  1.20 ) in the presence of human serum albumin (HSA). The  E - Z photoisomeriza-
tion between ( Z , Z ) - 99a  and ( E , Z ) - 99b  is not inhibited even in the binding cavity of HSA. 
Bilirubin - IIIa shows intense bisignate circular dichroism spectra in the chiral pocket of 
HSA. 81,82   The negative exciton coupling signal, which was observed upon irradiation of 
( Z , Z ) - bilirubin - IIIa/HSA complex with a broad - band blue light of   λ max  =  430  nm, was 
dramatically switched to a positive exciton coupling signal after irradiation with green 
light at 544  nm. 83   This signal switching, which is controllable by changing the irradiation 
wavelength, renders the system a potential chiroptical switch.   
 Zandomeneghi  et al.  reported the enantioselective photoinduced decomposition of 
1,1 ′ - binaphthol  100  (Scheme  1.21 ) included in bovine serum albumin (BSA). 
Complexation of ( R ) - (+) - and ( S ) - ( – ) - 100 with BSA revealed a remarkable difference 
in stability between the two diastereomeric complexes, and the BSA complex of ( S ) -
 ( – ) - 100  exhibited a signiﬁ cantly bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum. By 
selectively irradiating the ( S ) - ( – ) - 100  complex at longer wavelengths, ( R ) - (+) - 100 of 
up to 99.5% ee was obtained after 77% of the starting material (racemic  100 ) were 
decomposed. 84 – 86 
 Miranda  et al.  studied the excited - state behavior of chiral drugs bound to BSA and 
HSA. 87 – 89   Inclusion of carprofen  101  (Scheme  1.22 ) in HSA signiﬁ cantly lengthened the 
triplet - state lifetime of  101  as a result of more rigid surroundings and the suppression of 
self - quenching of  101 . The complexation of enantiomeric  101  with HSA caused a sig-
niﬁ cant difference in triplet lifetime, and the lifetime of ( S ) - 101  - HSA complex is 4 times 
shorter than that of ( R ) - 101  - HSA complex. Irradiation of  101  alone in aqueous buffer 
solution led to a polymerization of  101 . However, dechlorinated carprofen  102 was

in producing the corresponding ( S ) - and ( R ) - 102 . 
 The complexation behavior of organic substrates with proteins is usually very compli-
cated as a consequence of the diversiﬁ ed binding sites with distinctive size, shape, hydro-
phobicity and binding afﬁ nity. Since these binding sites differ in reactivity and selectivity, 
elucidation of binding behaviour is essential for understanding and manipulating the 
photoreaction performed in the binding sites of proteins. Inoue and co - workers have 
comprehensively studied the binding behaviour of 2 - anthracenecarboxylate (AC) (Scheme 
 1.9 ) to the hydrophobic pockets of BSA and HSA by a combined use of spectroscopic 
techniques, i.e. UV/Vis, ﬂ uorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy.  90 – 92 Although 
HSA and BSA share more than 95% of amino acid residues in common (i.e., 26 out of 
 ca.  600 amino acids), the two albumins display entirely different binding, photophysical 
and photochemical behavior. BSA possesses four binding sites, which accommodate 1, 
3, 2 and 3 AC molecules with individual binding constants of 5.3    ×  10 7 ,1.3  ×  10 5 , 1.4  ×  10 4 
and 3    ×  10 3  M  − 1 , respectively. In contrast, HSA provides ﬁ ve binding sites that accom-
modate 1, 1, 3, 5 and  > 10 AC molecules in the order of reducing binding ability.  93 – 97 
Although multiple AC molecules are bound to sites 2 – 4 of BSA and sites 3 – 5 of HSA, 
they do not appear to be very closely located to each other, since no exciton coupling 
was seen in the circular dichroism spectrum and no static quenching of ﬂ uorescence was 
detected. AC bound to site 1 of BSA shows highly structured ﬂ uorescence with dual 
lifetimes of 4.8 and 2.1   ns, which are assignable to two kinds of AC that differ in position 
or orientation in highly hydrophobic environment. However, ACs in site 2 of BSA gave 
a much longer lifetime of 13.3   ns and the ﬂ uorescence spectra became broader; the life-
times of AC in sites 3 and 4 are practically indistinguishable from that in bulk water 
(15.9   ns). Almost the same is true for HSA, except for the fact that not only the ﬁ rst but 
also the second site bind only one AC and are highly hydrophobic.

 Each binding site in BSA and HSA exhibits very different photochemical behaviour. 
Thus, the HT/HH ratio and enantioselectivity obtained in albumin - mediated AC photo-
cyclodimerization are dynamic functions of the AC/BSA or AC/HSA ratio. For example, 
the HT dimers are produced as the major products in the photodimerization of AC in 
host - free bulk water and also in the presence of HSA, whereas the HH dimers become 
the dominant products in the BSA - mediated photodimerization. In the presence of BSA 
(AC/BSA  =  1.3), chiral HT and HH dimers,  44  and  45 , were obtained in 29% and 41% 
ee, respectively. Interestingly, the ee ’ s for  44  and  45  were further improved up to 38% 
and 58% by adding nitromethane as a site - selective quencher of AC located in such 
binding sites that are more accessible but less enantioselective. 
 In the case of HSA, much higher 79% and 88% ee were reported for  44  and  45 , respec-
tively, at 25    ° C and AC/HSA   =   3. Temperature was found to have a modest effect on the 
enantioselectivity to give better ee ’ s of 82% and 90% for  44  and  45 , respectively, by 
decreasing the temperature to 5  ° C.

 Besides the natural and artiﬁ cial molecular hosts that are primarily based on organic 
compounds, photochemical reactions have also been investigated in the conﬁ ned spaces 
of inorganic nano -  or mesoarchitecture. Zeolites, which are porous crystalline alumino-
silicates composed of tetrahedral AlO 4  and SiO 4  building blocks and usually possess 
cages and channels of 4 – 14  Å , have been extensively used as hosts for mediating photo-
chemical reactions. The ratio of SiO 4 to AlO 4  can be changed from 1 to inﬁ nite, and metal 
cations are commonly introduced to balance the negative charge of AlO 4  units. The fau-
jasite and pentasil family of zeolites, which form roughly spherical supercages of  ca. 13  Å 
and tubular channels with lengths of  ca. 50  Å , are most commonly used zeolites for cata-
lyzing chemical reactions. Zeolites have a wide UV/Vis transparent region as a result of 
Al – O – Si framework that is similar to glass and quartz, and therefore are compatible with 
most organic compounds. The size and free volume zeolite supercages are adjustable by 
the number and sort of countercations. By virtue of these properties, zeolites have attracted 
much attention of photochemist as conﬁ ning media in the last two decades.

Molecular Encapsulation
 Studies on photochemical reactions within zeolites have already been summarized in 
several reviews.  98 – 102   The earliest work in this ﬁ eld appeared in 1980s.  103 – 106 Turro and 
co - workers investigated Norrish type I and type II photoreactions of phenyl alkyl ketones 
 103  in the supercage of faujasite - type zeolites. Photolysis of  103  in solution or solid state 
was known to give a variety of photoproducts  104 – 108 , depending on the molecular 
mobility, conformation and orbital overlap in the excited state. Inclusion of  103  in zeolites 
can signiﬁ cantly modify the above factors and lead to a switching of reaction selectivity. 
Photolysis of  103  in supercages of NaY zeolite gave a mixture of products with modest 
selectivities;  105 /( 107  +  108 )  =  0.72 – 0.83. The ratio was improved to 3.2 – 3.8 by using 
NaX zeolite, and was dramatically enhanced up to  > 50 by using silicalite (S - 115) zeolite,  105 
suggesting that this photoreaction is highly dependent on the cavity size of zeolite. 
 Photooxygenation of ( Z ) - enecarbamate  109  (Scheme  1.24 ) in solution gave methyl 
deoxybenzoin  112  in only a modest enantioselectivity even at a very low temperature, 
while a much better optical yield was obtained by starting from the ( E ) - isomer  110 . 107 – 111 
The conﬁ nement in zeolite supercage greatly restricts the orientation and conformation 
of photosubstrate and leads to a signiﬁ cant switching of reaction selectivity from that 
observed in isotropic media. Thus, singlet oxygenation of ( Z ) - 109  in NaY zeolite loaded 
with cationic dye sensitizer methylene blue (which is readily introduced into zeolite 
supercage through cation exchange and generates  1 O 2  from  3 O 2  upon irradiation) gave 
 112  in up to 80% ee. This is possibly due to the restricted space of zeolite supercage that 
aligns the substrate in an orientation suitable for   π - face - selective attack of the C = C bond 
by  1 O 2 . Compared to the high ee obtained in methylene - blue - exchanged NaY, the same 
reaction performed in LiY zeolite gave  112  in only 35% ee, for which the larger available 
volume in the supercage of LiY zeolite is possibly responsible. 
 Besides the well - conﬁ ned and rigid framework of zeolites, cation species also plays an 
important role in manipulating photochemical reaction occurring in the cavity.  112 – 121 The 
free volume in zeolite cavity relies on the number and sort of cations located in the cavity. 
Differing from isotropic media, in which the direction and magnitude of electric ﬁ eld 
ﬂ uctuate around a solvated molecule, cations in zeolite cavity generate a stronger, aniso-
tropic and more stable electric ﬁ eld. Such an electric ﬁ eld can polarize the included

molecules, distort their electron density, and even facilitate heterolytic bond cleavage. 
Indeed, it has been observed that the intensity and wavelength of absorption and emission 
of included aromatic compounds were signiﬁ cantly changed in the cavity of zeolite.  122 – 125 
Ramamurthy  et al.  reported that photoreaction of dibenzobarrelene  113 (Scheme  1.25 ) in 
Li + and Na +  exchanged zeolites resulted in triplet photoproduct  115  in 67% and 62% 
yield, respectively. This observation indicates that the intersystem crossing is signiﬁ cantly 
accelerated even by light atoms. However, this effect disappeared when the zeolites were 
equilibrated with water before use. The electric ﬁ eld of the cations in the cavity, which 
perturbs the symmetric nature of photosubstrate and facilitates the intersystem crossing, 
may be responsible for this  ‘ light atom ’  effect. On the other hand, the heavy atom effect 
is clearly seen even for hydrated cations, and  > 99% triplet photoproduct was observed 
with Tl + - incorporated zeolite. 126 – 129 
 Photoreactivity of androstenedione  116  (Scheme  1.26 ) was demonstrated to be dramati-
cally affected by the electric ﬁ eld of zeolite.  130   The epimerization of  116  to yield  117 is 
the major reaction in isotropic solution such as hexane, methylene chloride, methanol and 
cyclohexane. The reduction of the cyclohexenone A - ring can be observed in only propa-
nol, with  118  and  119  being given in 14% combined yield. However, irradiation of  116 
in NaY afforded exclusively the reduction products in  > 85% yield, and no product due 
to the reaction at the D - ring was observed. This reactivity change observed for the andros-
tenedione included in zeolite cavity was ascribed to the lowering of the   π , π  *   excited state 
of the A - ring due to the electric ﬁ eld in zeolite cavity. 
 Interactions between cation and photosubstrate, such as cation – π , cation – dipole and 
cation – lone pair interactions, may restrict the mobility and conformation of photosub-
strate, and therefore endow the cation with versatile roles in manipulating the reactivity 
and selectivity of photoreaction in zeolite cavity.  131 – 142 Ramamurthy and co - workers have 
studied stereoselective photoisomerization of diphenylcyclopropane derivatives in zeolite 
supercage. It was found that the photoisomerization of  trans - diphenylcyclopropane  121a 
occurred in the cavity of alkali cation - exchanged Y zeolite to give  cis - 120a  in high

efﬁ ciency, while the photolysis of  cis - 120a  failed to give any  trans - isomer. 134 This is 
ascribed to the formation of cation – π  complex in which two phenyl groups of  cis - 121a 
sandwich an alkali metal ion. The  cis  - isomer is thus stabilized and the isomerization 
reaction is inhibited. 
 However,  trans - isomers can be given upon photoirradiation of zeolite - mediated  cis -
 diphenylcyclopropane derivatives  120b – e due to the stronger cation – dipole interaction 
between cation and carboxamide group than cation – π  interaction. Photolysis of amide 
 120b – e in hexane - methylene chloride solution afforded the corresponding  trans - isomers 
in diastereomeric excess (de) less than 2%. In sharp contrast to the result obtained in 
isotropic solution, photoreaction of  120b – e  adsorbed in zeolite MY gave  trans - isomers 
in 20 – 83% de. The dramatic improvement of de is believed to occur as a result of cation –
 carbonyl and cation – nitrogen dipolar interactions that ﬁ x the conformation of reactants, 
with asymmetric centres of the chiral amide moiety being located closer to the chirogenic 
center. 114,132,134,138,143 
 Chiral photochemistry in zeolite is an intriguing topic that has attracted intensive atten-
tion. Although theoretically zeolites can be chiral, until now no chiral zeolite has been 
separated in an enantiomerically pure form. Chiral photochemistry in zeolite is conducted 
primarily through two strategies: the ﬁ rst one is to introduce a chiral auxiliary to photo-
substrate and the diastereodifferentiating photoreaction is conducted in intact zeolite, as 
exempliﬁ ed in the diastereoselective photoisomerization of diphenylcyclopropane deriva-
tives mentioned above, and the second one is to immobilize optically active compound 
to chirally modify the zeolite supercage and the enantiodifferentiating photoreaction of 
prochiral substrate is conducted in this chiral supercage. 
 Zeolites modiﬁ ed with norephedrine, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as chiral induc-
tors have been employed for the enantioselective photocyclization of a series of tropolone 
derivatives  122 . 113,144,145   Photocyclization of  122b  conducted in NaY zeolite modiﬁ ed with 
( – ) - ephedrine gave  123b  in up to 78% ee. The enantioselectivity of the photoreaction was 
found to be critically controlled by the cationic species and water content in zeolites. 
 The optical yield of photoreaction in chirally modiﬁ ed zeolite relies on several factors 
such as cation, chiral inductor and its loading level, which is usually kept at a high level 
to maximize the number of chiral inductors located around the photosubstrate. An excep-
tional example may be found in the enantiodifferentiating photoisomerization of  34Z 
(Scheme  1.7 ) sensitized by optically active (poly)alkyl benzoate derivatives immobilized

in NaY zeolite reported by Inoue and co - workers.  146   The photoreaction was allowed to 
occur in the presence of a catalytic amount of sensitizer, and  34E  was obtained in a modest 
ee of 4.5% upon photosensitization with ( – ) - methylheptyl benzoate - immobilized NaY 
zeolite. In contrast, the same sensitizer gave racemic  34E in homogenous solution. 
 1.4.2  Photochemical Reactions in Mesoporous Materials 
 Mesoporous materials have recently attracted considerable attention for the use in pho-
tochemical reactions. As deﬁ ned by the IUPAC nomenclature rules, mesoporous materials 
have a pore diameter in the range of 2.0 – 50.0   nm, which is much larger in general than 
that of zeolite and is certainly beyond the size of normal organic substrates. Therefore, 
photoreactions can freely proceed without suffering any restriction. In fact, studies on 
photochemical reaction in mesoporous materials focus more on construction of functional 
materials rather than the chemical selectivity. For example, azobenzene, which is structur-
ally rigid and has a van der Waals volume of 144    Å 3 , 147   requires a large extra volume of 
127  Å 3  for the photoisomerization to occur. Taking advantage of this property, azobenzene 
was loaded into nanocomposite ﬁ lms to be used for and showed a potential application 
in adjusting the cavity volume of mesoporous materials.  148 Mal  et al.  constructed a pho-
tochemically controlled system by anchoring coumarin to the pore openings of MCM - 41 
for taking up or releasing organic guests by controlling the reversible photodimerization 
of coumarin. 149 
 The size of mesoporous silica MCM - 41 can be adjusted by changing the number of 
carbon atoms in surfactant micelles used in the hydrothermal synthesis. Iwamoto and 
co - workers have reported photocyclization of diarylethenes  124 in different - sized MCM -
 41. Only the anti - parallel conformation of open form  124  can undergo cyclization upon 
irradiation to give closed form  125 . The reaction rate of  124  was found to be remarkably 
dependent on the amount of  124  loaded as well as the pore diameter of MCM - 41s, but 
be independent of the organic groups on the surface of MCM - 41s. 150 
 Recently, Inoue and co - workers studied the enantiodifferentiating photocyclodimeriza-
tion of AC in the channel of mesoporous silica that is modiﬁ ed with   γ - CD. 151 
Photocyclodimerization of AC with mesoporous without   γ - CD gave HH photodimers

with a low conversion and enantioselectivity. In remarkable contrast to the   γ - CD - mediated 
photoreaction performed in aqueous solution, the photocyclodimerization of AC in   γ - 
CD - modiﬁ ed mesoporous silica led to the major formation of HH photodimers, in par-
ticular  anti - HH dimer  45 in 45% yield and 24.1% ee. 
 1.4.3  Photochemical Reaction with Self - Assembled Molecular Cages 
 Organic ligands bearing two or more coordinating sites can form well - structured aggre-
gates upon coordination to metals. Some of these ligand – metal self - assemblies form 
structurally well - conﬁ ned cavity that can accommodate organic guests of suitable size. 
These cages generally have polyhedron structure with rigid skeleton, and the motion of 
guest(s) included in the cavity is greatly inhibited. Thermal and photochemical reactions 
conducted in these molecular cages often show remarkably accelerated rates and signiﬁ -
cantly high selectivities. 152,153 
 Compounds  126  and  127  shown in Scheme  1.30  represent two typical coordination 
cages that are self - assembled from six palladium ions and four tridentate ligands. These 
coordination cages are well soluble in water and can selectively encapsulate organic 
substrates in the nano - sized cavity in a well - arranged fashion, mainly through hydropho-
bic and aromatic interactions. So far, a number of different types of photoreactions have 
been examined within the cavities of these molecular cages.  154 – 160   As shown in Scheme 
 1.31 , four stereoisomers  129a - d  are theoretically possible to be formed upon photocy-
clodimerization of  128 . Strikingly, photocyclodimerization of 0.5   mM  128  in the cavity 
of  126a  gave the HT  syn - isomer  129a  as a sole product in  > 98% yield after 3 h irradia-
tion. On the contrary, photoirradiation of  128  in benzene in the absence of host  126a gave 
no adducts even at a high concentration of 150   mM. In the presence of  127a  as a host, 
photocyclodimerization of  130  in aqueous solution exclusively afforded  syn - dimer  131a . 
This is in sharp contrast to the same photoreaction conducted in benzene without any 
host, where  anti - dimer  131b  (21% yield) was favored over  syn - dimer  131a  (2% yield).

The remarkable reactivity and selectivity observed with these molecular vessels are 
attributed to the greatly increased concentration and the strictly regulated orientation of 
substrates in the well - conﬁ ned cavity. 
 The cavity of molecular cage  126a  is achiral in origin. Interestingly, a chiral cavity 
can be constructed simply by replacing the peripheral ethylenediamine with optically 
active diamines, with the original electronic nature, size and T symmetry element being

maintained on the whole. Cross addition of  132 and  133 (Scheme  1.32 ) in the cavity of 
 126b – e  (Scheme  1.30 ) gave a single product  134 , which is ascribed to steric control 
arising from the conﬁ ned cavity rather than orbital control.  158   The optical yields of this 
photoaddition reaction increased upon increasing the steric bulk of the  N - substituent on 
the chiral diamine and ﬁ nally gave  134b  in 50% ee with  126c . This observation is indica-
tive that peripheral chiral auxiliaries, which locate far away from the reaction center and 
induce only a slight deformation of the triazine panel, are possible to produce considerable 
asymmetric induction for the photoreaction occurring in the coordinated cages. 
 1.5  Photochemical Reactions with other Artiﬁ cial Hosts 
 1.5.1  Photochemical Reactions with Dendrimers 
 Dendrimers are highly branched globular molecules which are generally well - deﬁ ned, 
effectively monodispersed and highly symmetric.  161 – 163   A dendrimer is composed of three 
architectural region: a core moiety, branched repeating units derived from the core and 
end groups on the periphery of the molecule. Properly designed high - generation dendrim-
ers possess a distinct interior space that is sterically protected from solvent molecules, 
and therefore dendrimers can serve as container molecules. An elegant  ‘ dendritic box ’ 
that can accommodate small organic molecules and control their release by modifying 
the steric crowding of the dendritic periphery has been described by Meijer  et al. 164 
 Poly(alky aryl ether) dendrimers  135  (Scheme  1.33 ), possessing carboxylic acid or 
hydroxyl group at their periphery, were synthesized and used as hosts for several photo-
reactions. 165 Both  135a  and  135b  are water soluble under the base condition and capable 
of including organic molecules mainly through hydrophobic interaction. Photolysis of 
1 - phenyl - 3 - p - tolyl - 2 - propanone  136  led to   α  - cleavage to form radical pairs, which after 
decarbonylation recombine to give diarylethanes  137a ,  137b  and  137c . The photolysis of 
 136  in hexane solution gave the product  137a ,  137b  and  137c in a ratio 2.4  :  1.0  :  1.4, 
indicating a zero  ‘ cage effect, ’  where the  ‘ cage effect ’  was deﬁ ned as ([ 137a ] – [ 137b ] –
 [ 137c ])/([ 137a ]  +  [ 137b ]  +  [ 137c ]). Interestingly, photoreaction of  136  mediated by G1, 
G2 and G3 acid dendrimers  135b  showed the gradually increasing cage effects of 0.09, 
0.18 and 0.50, respectively, suggesting stronger conﬁ nement with increasing dendrimer

generation. Photolyses of  136  encapsulated by G3 of  135a  gave a larger cage effect of 
0.77, revealing that the phenolic dendrimer  135a  is more strongly conﬁ ning than the acid 
dendrimer  135b . 
 Photolysis of benzoin ethyl ether  138  was demonstrated to be sensitive to the reaction 
media employed. It affords Norrish type I products  139c  and  139d  in more than 94% 
combined yield in hexane but type II products  139a  and  139b  in 73% yield in aqueous 
alkaline solution. Photoreaction of  138  with dendrimer  135b  predominantly gave the type 
II products, particularly  139a  in 95% yield. However, when the photoreaction was medi-
ated by  135a ,  139a and  139b were produced in 21% and 57% yield, respectively, sug-
gesting that the end group plays an important role in dictating the interior character of 
the dendrimers.

 1.5.2  Photochemical Reactions with Hydrogen - Bonding Templates 
 Hydrogen bonding interaction plays vital roles in regulating biochemical processes of 
proteins and deoxyribonucleic acids, and has been widely utilized for constructing 
supramolecular architectures. This is due to the largest interaction energy (5 – 30  kJ  mol  − 1 ) 
among the non - covalent weak interactions as well as the ability to assemble molecules 
at right distance and angle. As a result of these advantages, a series of photochemical 
reactions have been investigated using hydrogen - bonding templates.   
 Bassani and co - workers investigated the complexation behavior of melamine and bar-
bituric acid derivatives, and examined the photodimerization of styrene, stilbene and 
cinnamate mediated by hydrogen bonding templates. 166 – 170 Melamine derivatives  140 
(Scheme  1.34 ), which have a hydrogen - bonding motif complementary to barbituric acid 
derivatives such as  141 , are possible to sequentially form 1  :  1 and 1  :  2 hydrogen - bonded 
complexes with  141 . As illustrated in Scheme  1.35 ,  140  and  141  can form two kinds of 
1   :   1 complexes and three kinds of 1   :   2 complexes, among which only complex C is 
expected to accelerate the photodimerization of  140 . Each of the binding constants K 1 
and K 2  should be a sum of these binding constants weighted by their population. A posi-
tive cooperativity (K 2  >  K 1 ) was observed upon complexation of  141b  with  140a,b , 
presumably as a combined result of allosteric and electronic effects. Photoirradiation of 
 140  without any template led to a fast  E - to - Z  isomerization to give the  Z / E  ratio of 1.1 – 5.5 
at the photostationary state, although elongated irradiations resulted in a formation of 
dimers. The existence of barbiturate  141  considerably improved the efﬁ ciency and selec-
tivity of the photoreaction. The quantum yields of  142a  and  142b  were increased respec-
tively from 0.7  ×  10  − 3 and 0.1  ×  10  − 3 in the absence of a template to 2.3  ×  10  − 3 and 
0.8  ×  10  − 3  in the presence of  141a . 170   The same strategy was applied to a barbituric acid 
derivative of fullerene to give a photodimer of fullerene, which could not been obtained 
without the hydrogen - bonding template. 169 
 Bach and co - workers investigated a series of chiral photoreactions that were mediated 
by Kamp ’ s triacid derivatives  143  working as chiral hydrogen - bonding templates.  171 – 177 
As illustrated in Scheme  1.37 , these chiral templates possess an amide (lactam) group to 
bind an amide substrate through dual hydrogen bonds and also a bulky substituent to 
shield one of the enantiofaces of substrate when bound to the template. Although these

facing side. Increasing the amount of chiral template or lowering the reaction temperature, 
by which the ratio of bound photosubstrate is greatly increased, signiﬁ cantly improved 
the enantioselectivity in the photocycloaddition of  144 . By performing the photoreaction 
in the presence of  143b  at  − 60  ° C,  145  was given in up to 93% ee. In contrast, the same 
reaction sensitized by a chiral sensitizer lacking the hydrogen - bonding site gave only 
racemic photoproducts.  179 
 Since photoexcitation of free substrate existing in the bulk solution will give racemic 
photoproducts, at least an equimolar amount of chiral template is necessary in order to 
obtain photoproduct with good enantioselectivity. A recent report by Bach  et al. presented 
a good solution for this shortcoming by covalently grafting a sensitizer to a chiral tem-
plate. Thus, sensitizing template  143c  (Scheme  1.37 ) bearing a photoinduced electron 
transfer sensitizer was synthesized for the use in photosensitized cycloaddition of  146 . 
Photolysis of  146  in the presence of 0.1 equivalent amount of  143c  afforded  147  in 52 -
 64% yield with up to 70% ee (Scheme  1.39 ). 180

 Mattay  et al. examined the intramolecular [2+2] photocycloadditions of 1,6 - dienes  152 
catalyzed by copper(I) coordinated to chiral ligands  151 (Scheme  1.41 ). 182 Photocycloaddition 
of  152 catalyzed by  151c gave  153 in up to 5% ee. 
 Bassani and co - workers studied the photodimerization of  154  using a synergistic effect 
of hydrogen bonding and metal ion complexation.  183   Photodimerization of  154  was accel-
erated by a factor of 2 in the presence of one equivalent of KPF 6 , and a factor of 5 in the 
coexistence of KPF 6  and  155 . Among the metal ions examined, Ba 2+  showed the most 
signiﬁ cant cooperative effect. While  155  enhanced the photodimerization by a factor of 
1.4 – 1.8, a simultaneous use of  155 and Ba 2+ gave the quantum yield for the formation of 
 156  and  157  in more than three orders of magnitude greater than that obtained in the 
absence of template, and the ratio of  156 / 157 was greatly improved from 1 to 3.7.

 1.6  Photoreaction Control by External Variants 
 While most studies on supramolecular photochemistry have focused on the design and 
synthesis of suitable hosts that provide desirable interaction or environment for aimed 
photosubstrates, recent studies by Inoue  et al.  suggest that the external factors, such as 
temperature, solvent and pressure, may also play a crucial role in controlling the reactivity 
and selectivity of photoreactions in supramolecular systems. Changing environmental 
variants, which is much easier to practice than the optimization of host structure involving 
tedious syntheses, can provide not only a convenient, yet useful, tool for controlling 
photochemical outcomes, but also important information regarding the mechanism of 
supramolecular photochemical reaction. 
 The effect of temperature has been well established in the photosensitized isomerization 
of cycloalkenes with conventional sensitizers.  184 – 187   The change of optical yield upon 
temperature variation is ascribed to the non - zero differential entropy change for the for-
mation of enantiomeric photoproducts. The entropy effect on supramolecular photochi-
rogenesis systems was found to be closely related to the structural properties of 
supramolecular hosts. The enantioselectivity shows only small changes with the variation 
of temperature in photoisomerization of  34Z  sensitized by   β - CD - based chromophores. 37 
This insigniﬁ cant effect of temperature is attributed to the low entropy environment in 
the cavity of   β  - CD due to its rigid skeleton arising from the hydrogen - bonding network 
at the secondary rim. 
 On the contrary, photoisomerization of  158ZZ with sensitizer - appended   γ - CD, which 
has a more ﬂ exible framework than   γ  - CD, is more sensitive to the temperature alternation. 
An inversion of product chirality was observed by lowering the temperature in the pho-
toisomerization of  158ZZ  mediated by  159 . 188   Similar phenomenon was observed in 
photocyclodimerization of AC (Scheme  1.9 ) included in the cavity of   γ - CD derivatives. 189 
The enantioselectivity for HH dimer in the photocyclodimerization of AC with diamino -    γ 
 - CDs  48 in aqueous methanol solution decreased greatly by lowering the reaction tem-
perature and even showed a dramatic inversion to give the antipodal product. When   γ - CD 
derivatives  50a – d with ﬂ exible caps were used, the ee values obtained for  44  were highly 
dependent on the temperature. However, in the presence of   γ - CD derivatives  57a – c , which 
possess a rigid aryldisulfonate cap, the enantiodifferentiation become much less temper-
ature - dependent. 52   On the other hand, when photoisomerization of  34Z  was carried out

with permethylated   β - CD sensitizers  35e – h , in which the hydrogen bonding network is 
broken by methylation to give a ﬂ exible skeleton, the temperature effect became pro-
nounced to afford a chirality inversion by changing the temperature. 
 These observations suggest that the entropy effect is a function of the ﬂ exibility/rigidity 
of the skeleton of supramolecular hosts, and is signiﬁ cant for hosts with ﬂ exible frame-
work but is insigniﬁ cant with rigid hosts. Indeed, works of the other research groups have 
also demonstrated that hosts bearing rigid skeleton such as zeolite show only slight 
temperature - dependence. 
 Solvation and desolvation are of paramount importance for molecular recognition in 
solution. Solvent inﬂ uences the binding strength of host – guest equilibrium in a diverse 
way for various host – guest systems. For example, the complexation strength between 
18 - crown - 6 and potassium ion decreases by a factor of  > 10 4  on going from propylene 
carbonate to water.  190 This signiﬁ cant solvent dependence mainly comes from the differ-
ence in desolvation energy of the metal cation in different solvent. In some cases, solvent 
may play a role of ﬁ ller upon co - inclusion with the guest substrate to signiﬁ cantly modify 
the orientation of substrate in the host cavity. It is known that CD bind organic guests 
mainly through hydrophobic interactions, and addition of methanol to the aqueous solu-
tion greatly reduces the binding constant as a result of increased solvation to both of 
substrate and host. The plot of log Ks for the complexation of  35  and  34Z  against the 
methanol content showed good straight lines, suggesting that no selective solvation by 
water or methanol to CD derivatives occurs and water – methanol mixture behaves as a 
bulk solvent of continuously changing hydrophilicity. The enantioselectivity in photo-
isomerization of  34Z  with  35  decreases with increasing content of methanol, and appears 
to be a nice function of host occupancy. On the other hand, addition of methanol decreases 
the solvent polarity and thus increases the electrostatic interaction of ion pairs. In aqueous 
solution, the photodimerization of AC mediated by  48a – d  shows only subtle effect of the 
ammonium cations introduced to the primary rim of   γ  - CD, but the electrostatic interaction 
dominates the photodimerization to give the chiral HH dimer as the major product with 
a greatly enhanced enantioselectivity. 
 Hydrostatic pressure is also known to play crucial roles in conventional chiral photo-
sensitization of  34Z , as demonstrated by the fact that product chirality can be manipulated 
or even inverted by simply changing the pressure when the differential activation volume 
for the formation of the enantiomeric or diastereomeric pair is not equal to zero. Under 
high pressure, less volume - demanding structures and processes are absolutely favoured 
and hence the host - guest association process is advantageous in principle. If there are two 
or more possible complex structures in a supramolecular system, dramatic equilibrium 
and selectivity shifts may occur from a shallow, loose and/or bulky complex to a deeper, 
tighter and compact ones under high pressure. In other words, we acquire an additional 
tool, that is pressure as an environmental variant, for manipulating the recognition ability 
and selectivity of a given guest. Another somewhat unexpected great advantage of high 
pressure applied to supramolecular systems performed in aqueous solutions is the signiﬁ -
cant lowering of the melting temperature of water, which goes down to  − 25  ° C at 210  MPa, 
which enables us to perform photochemical reactions below zero Celsius even in water. 
Thus, the chemical yield and ee of HT dimer  44  were greatly enhanced in the photocy-
clodimerization of AC mediated by   γ  - CD derivatives to reach 53% yield and 71% ee by 
using host  54 in water at  − 22  ° C at 210  MPa.

 More recently, the effect of pH was investigated in the supramolecular photochirogenic 
dimerization of AC with  p - cresolbisbenzimidazole - capped   γ - CDs  160a,b . 191 Thus, pho-
todimerization of AC with AE - capped   γ - CD  160b  gave  anti  - HH dimer in 5% ee at pH 
11 but the antipodal product in 28% ee at pH 6. The conformational change of the ioniz-
able capping moiety upon the pH variation is responsible for the pH - dependent 
enantioselectivity. 
 1.7  Conclusions 
 Controlling photochemistry through molecular recognition has drawn signiﬁ cant interest 
from a broad spectrum of scientists and met great progress in recent decades. A number 
of supramolecular hosts have been successfully exploited for conducting various types of 
photochemical reactions to reveal the distinct advantages and disadvantages peculiar to 
each supramolecular system. The multiple non - covalent interactions and the conﬁ nement 
effect operating in host cavity are two major factors that control the supramolecular 
photochemistry. Successful supramolecular photoreaction requires reasonable design and 
synthesis of host molecules and a careful selection of suitable photoreaction and substrate. 
The complementary ﬁ tting of size, shape and interaction motif between host and guest 
substrate are crucially important in choosing a host – guest pair for speciﬁ c supramolecular 
photochemistry. In general, supramolecular hosts that have more conﬁ ned binding sites 
usually show speciﬁ c complexation ability and signiﬁ cant reaction selectivity, while those 
with ﬂ exible binding sites are susceptive to the external control by environmental factors. 
 The supramolecular approach to photochemistry is undoubted a smart efﬁ cient way to 
manipulate and enhance its reactivity and selectivity. In addition to the electronic and 
orbital properties governing the conventional photoreactions in isotropic media, the steric 
and conformational effects play heavier roles in supramolecular photochemistry. As a 
result, photoreactions in supramolecular systems often show unique behavior distinctively 
different from that of conventional one. On the other hand, the conﬁ nement effect of 
supramolecular hosts can hold two or more photosubstrates in close proximity and con-
sequentially promote bi -  and multimolecular photoreactions that are silent in conventional 
photochemistry under normal conditions.

37
 Despite that supramolecular complexation can crucially affect the steric and/or elec-
tronic properties of photosubstrates in both ground and excited state, the stereochemical 
control of photochemical reaction in supramolecular systems is often considered to be 
dominated by the prearrangement of photosubstrate in the ground state. A photosubstrate 
is captured by a host for a period of time that is much longer than the excited - state life-
time. It has been demonstrated that the rate constant for a photosubstrate to get into the 
cavity of host with a sufﬁ ciently large opening is normally in the order 10  − 7 – 10  − 8  M  − 1  S  − 1 . 192 
An organic guest may stay in the cavity for much longer than 1    µ s if it has a binding 
constant of 1000   M  − 1  with the host, which is signiﬁ cantly longer than the lifetime of 
excited molecules commonly encountered. Therefore, the complexation behaviour of 
photosubstrate in the ground state is of signiﬁ cant importance in supramolecular 
photochemistry. 
 Optimizing the structure and interactions of a supramolecular system still requires 
sophisticated design, synthesis, and experimental feedback even in the ground state, and 
should be much more difﬁ cult for supramolecular photochemical reactions. In this context, 
the combined use of external factors, such as temperature, solvent and pressure, provides 
a versatile and convenient tool for manipulating photochemical reactions in supramolecu-
lar system. The role of these external factors is closely correlated with the properties, in 
particular rigidity, of supramolecular host employed, and the outcomes are often signiﬁ -
cantly different from those observed in conventional photoreactions, which would be 
another reason for performing photochemical reaction in supramolecular system. 
 The number and quality of publications on supramolecular photochirogenesis are 
rapidly growing in the last decade. Laying in the interdisciplinary area of supramolecular 
chemistry, photochemistry and asymmetric synthesis, this new area of science is still 
challenging but appears promising, proposing a novel concept and methodology for 
overcoming the relatively weak and short - lived interactions in the excited state through 
multiple supramolecular interactions in both ground and excited states. Indeed, the highest 
enantioselectivity in solution - phase photoreaction has been achieved by supramolecular 
photochirogenesis. 193 
 In summary, the control of photochemical reactions by molecular recognition becomes 
one of the most active topics in supramolecular chemistry in recent years. However, 
supramolecular photochemistry is still conceptually less established, mechanistically less 
understood, and experimentally less explored compared to the conventional supramolecu-
lar chemistry in the ground state. We believe that further comprehensive studies in this 
area will reveal more intriguing features of supramolecular photochemistry and strength 
our capability to control photochemical reactions.

Cyclodextrins  
 Ronald  Breslow 
 Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 
 2.1  Introduction 
 Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligomers of glucose (Figure  2.1 ). The most common are   α -
 cyclodextrin with six glucoses in a ring ( 1 ),   β  - cyclodextrin with seven glucoses ( 2 ), and 
 γ - cyclodextrin ( 3 ) with eight glucoses in the ring. Because of all the sugar hydroxyls these 
compounds are reasonably soluble in water but the interior cavities are relatively non -
 polar, with about the polarity of dioxane. Thus in water the cyclodextrins can reversibly 
bind hydrophobic substrates into their cavities, and within the complexes chemical reac-
tions can occur. 
 Friedrich Cramer did the ﬁ rst work in this area,  1   and early work was done by Myron 
Bender. 2,3   In Bender ’ s studies, a bound ester reacted with a hydroxyl group on the rim of 
the cyclodextrin to undergo a transesteriﬁ cation, with reasonable geometric selectivity 
and some rate acceleration. This was followed up with substrates better designed to be 
accelerated by such a process, and this will be the ﬁ rst part of the review. Then there are 
some reactions in which cyclodextrin promotes a process but is not itself transformed, 
and the ﬁ rst example of this was work we reported on selective aromatic substitution, the 
second section of this review. I also describe the use of cyclodextrins to catalyse Diels –
 Alder reactions, in which both the diene and the dienophile can bind into the cyclodextrin 
cavity in water and in  ‘ water - like ’ solvents.

Molecular Encapsulation
 Then systems are described in which the cyclodextrin binding group has catalytic 
groups attached to it, to mimic enzymes whose binding groups and catalytic groups are 
not the same. The ﬁ rst section describes catalysed hydrolysis reactions with metal ions 
bound to ligands that are attached to one or two cyclodextrins. Then mimics of ribonu-
clease enzymes in which two catalytic groups are attached in well - deﬁ ned positions to a 
cyclodextrin are described. There follows brief descriptions of studies on simple binding 
by cyclodextrin dimers and trimers. 
 Extensive studies on mimics of transaminase enzymes follow, and then mimics of 
enzymes that use thiamine pyrophosphate as their coenzyme. Studies on mimics of 
enzymes that perform aldol condensations are then described. After a brief section on 
mimics of enzymes that use coenzyme B 12  as a coenzyme, there is a description of mimics 
of cytochrome P - 450 oxidizing enzymes, in which as many as four cyclodextrins are 
involved in binding. 
 We have written a number of reviews of our work in this ﬁ eld. 4 – 16   Our chapter in 
Chemical Reviews  14   was particularly comprehensive, and covered the work in many other 
laboratories besides our own. There are actually two other chapters on reactions in cyclo-
dextrins in this book.  17,18   It has been agreed that each of our laboratories will concentrate 
chieﬂ y on the work that we ourselves have done. 
 2.2  Acylations of the Cyclodextrins by Bound Substrates 
 Myron Bender had reported that a meta -  t - butylphenyl acetate ( 4 ) acetylated   β - cyclodextrin 
in water with a rate 250 times as fast as that for hydrolysis of that same substrate at 
the same pH.  2   We had shown that the same reaction was even faster in a mixed DMSO/
water solvent, but still the acceleration was not what one would have hoped for.  19 
Model - building suggested that in the acylation reaction the tetrahedral intermediate is 
partly pulled out of the cavity, so cyclodextrin binding is to some extent ﬁ ghting against 
the reaction rate. Thus we made a new substrate, the  p - nitrophenyl ester of ferrocene-
acrylic acid ( 5 ), and saw that it acylated   β  - cyclodextrin with a rate acceleration of 
51,000 compared with the hydrolysis rate in free solution.  20   With this substrate there
