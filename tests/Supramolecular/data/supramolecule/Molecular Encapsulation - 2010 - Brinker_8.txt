Chemical Reactions with RNA and DNA Enzymes

trapped via a chemoselective modiﬁ cation with biotin hydrazide. The function of this 
ribozyme is analogous to the natural alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme (ADH) and depends 
also on the same cofactors. 10   Furthermore this ribozyme was coupled with an electron 
transfer process between NADH and FAD. Thus a NAD +  regeneration system is consti-
tuted. Interestingly, the reverse reaction, the RNA - catalysed reduction of the aldehyde, is 
also possible in presence of NADH.  24 This is the ﬁ rst clear - cut demonstration of a typical 
redox reaction catalysed by RNA. 
 Further artiﬁ cial ribozymes are known to react with cosubstrates, for example acylating 
the thiol group of tethered Co - enzyme A with the AMP - activated biotin. These ribozymes 
also produce the crucial metabolic intermediates acetyl - CoA and butyryl - CoA at substan-
tial reaction rates. For the selection of this ribozyme, the employed RNA pool had been 
coupled at its 5 ′  - end to CoA by a previously isolated capping ribozyme.  19 Ribozymes for 
a number of related reactions were isolated, and the reader is referred to an excellent 
review discussing in detail the current knowledge on ribozyme catalysis in the context of 
the RNA world hypothesis. 26 
 The current hypothesis predicts evolution of the RNA world into the modern DNA −
 RNA − protein world, thereby DNA taking over the storage of genomic information. One 
advantage of DNA over RNA as genetic material is the better chemical and enzymatic 
stability of deoxynucleic acids. That same advantage also comes to bear as a property 
of deoxyribozymes, of which a wide range has been selected by now. Despite this, there 
is little evidence that ribozymes from the RNA world might have been replaced by 
deoxyribozymes. Rather, proteins have taken over the vast majority of catalytic 
functions. 
 The intrinsically restricted functionality of nucleic acids as compared to proteins is a 
serious shortcoming for the expression of catalytic potential. A possible remedy is the 
introduction of additional, non - natural functional groups  via  the incorporation of modiﬁ ed 
nucleotides. 29   The tolerance of the employed RNA polymerase towards the modiﬁ cations 
limits the general use of this technique for the generation of modiﬁ ed ribozymes. Many 
such ribozymes with modiﬁ ed bases catalyse RNA cleavage or ligation. Further catalytic 
activities concern metalation of  N  - methylmesoporphyrin, formation of a phosphodiester 
bond with a deoxynucleotide, and cleavage of phosphodiester  in trans  under simulated 
physiological conditions. 
 The incorporation by T7 RNA polymerase and successful use in SELEX of a number 
of uridine derivatives was reported by Eaton ’ s laboratory, resulting in the development 
of a cupric ion - dependent modiﬁ ed ribozyme with Diels – Alderase activity. 13 To current 
knowledge, the Diels – Alder reaction does not play a major role in any biochemical 
pathway, and the use of modiﬁ ed nucleotides to expand the catalytic repertoire of RNA 
was certainly not undertaken with the RNA world as principal motivation. Rather, these 
approaches underscore the potential for application of catalytic RNA in modern ﬁ elds of 
biotechnology and organic synthesis. The use of proteic enzymes in organic synthesis has 
become a commonplace strategy where applicable, the limiting factor being the choice 
of suitable enzymes and their respective substrate speciﬁ cities. From this perspective, 
several ribozymes display catalytic activity of high interest to the organic chemist (see 
Table  14.2 ). Importantly, most of these ribozymes have been obtained using a direct 
selection protocol, where the choice of reactants has dictated the substrate speciﬁ city of 
the resulting ribozymes.

 Thus, the direct selection method holds the alluring possibility to engineer substrate -
 speciﬁ c ribozymes which are tailored to the particular reaction an organic chemist might 
wish to carry out. Since nucleic acids are chiral, one can even anticipate stereoselectivity 
in the would - be custom - made catalysts. Although this remains a vision yet to be accom-
plished, several cases of ribozymes with promising properties have been reported, accel-
erating certain redox reactions, Michael additions and cycloadditions. Already mentioned 
was the oxidation of a benzyl alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde, and the reverse 
reaction from Suga`s laboratory. The redox ribozymes still require their substrate to be 
covalently bound, meaning they act  in cis , thus performing neither true catalysis nor 
multiple turnover. 10 
 In the Famulok laboratory, a ribozyme was isolated which promotes a reaction corre-
sponding to the ﬁ rst step of the formation of dTMP from dUMP in proteic thymidylate 
synthases. This ribozyme mediates Michael - adduct formation at a Michael - acceptor sub-
strate. The reaction is accelerated by a factor of nearly 10 5 . The selected ribozyme could 
be engineered to act in an intermolecular reaction on a substrate tethered to an RNA 
oligomer. The demonstration of RNA catalysis of this reaction has bearings on the RNA 
world hypothesis, as well as implications for possible synthetic applications. 18 
 14.5  Deoxyribozymes  –  DNA Molecules with Catalytic Properties 
 While there is still no demonstration that DNA carries out catalytic functions in present -
 day biology, numerous DNAzymes have been developed by in vitro selection. While the 
spectrum is not as wide as for ribozymes, it clearly goes far beyond what was imagined 
a few years back (Table  14.3 ). 30 
 One class of deoxyribozymes has found routine practical applications in molecular 
biology. These are deoxyribozymes that cleave target RNAs in a highly predicable, 
sequence - speciﬁ c manner, thereby acting as designer nucleases. These DNAzymes gener-
ally utilize as nucleophile the 2 ′  - OH group on the RNA substrate adjacent to the phos-
phodiester bond to be cleaved and generate cleavage products with a 5 ′ - OH and a 
2 ′ ,3 ′ - cyclophosphate terminus, respectively, which can be easily processed by other 
enzymes.

 DNAzymes can also cleave DNA. This is, however, achieved by an oxidative mecha-
nism involving freely diffusible hydroxyl radicals. The site and sequence speciﬁ city of 
cleavage is low, limiting the synthetic utility of these enzymes. 
 Many DNAzymes catalyse RNA ligation reactions to yield linear, branched, and 
lariat - type reaction products. The ligation of DNA strands as well as the phosphoryla-
tion of DNA or RNA oligonucleotides was described. Some notable extensions beyond 
phosphodiester chemistry include a photoreversion reaction, a deglycosylation, porphyrin 
metalation, nucleopeptide bond formation, and ﬁ nally a Diels – Alder reaction. This latter 
reaction is essentially the same studied by the J ä schke lab with RNA as a catalyst (as 
discussed below in more detail), and the information published to - date indicates that 
the catalytic proﬁ ciency of DNA and RNA enzymes for Diels – Alder reactions is very 
similar. 
 Like in the case of RNA, DNAzymes were created with a variety of  ‘ side chains ’ , 
ranging from imidazol groups to primary amines and imidines. 31 
 14.6  Catalysis of  C − C Bond Formation by Diels – Alderase Ribozymes 
 In this last section, I will discuss structure and mechanism of one artiﬁ cial ribozyme in 
more detail. This ribozyme, selected in my laboratory, is the only RNA catalyst for small -
 molecule chemistry with a known spatial structure, and due to extensive studies, it is 
arguably the best - characterized artiﬁ cial ribozyme known to - date. These data provide for 
the ﬁ rst time an insight into how a small RNA can accelerate reactions different from 
phosphodiester chemistry, and what structural prerequisites are required. 
 14.6.1  In Vitro Selection 
 The selection started with an RNA library of  ∼ 2  ×  10 14  sequences of 160 nucleotide 
length. 11   After tethering the RNA to anthracene via long ﬂ exible PEG chains, this library 
was allowed to react for with an excess of biotinylated maleimide. Biotinylated RNA was 
recovered using immobilized strepavidin, and selection pressure was gradually increased 
by reducing reaction time and maleimide concentration. After 10 iterations of selection 
and ampliﬁ cation, the enriched library showed  ∼ 6,500 - fold rate acceleration, compared 
to the starting library. Individual members of this enriched library were sequenced and 
assayed for activity. 
 32 of the 35 catalytically active RNAs were found to share a common motif (Figure 
 14.3 ): Central element is an asymmetric internal bubble comprised of the two consensus 
sequences UGCCA and AAUACU, framed by two helices (helix II and III, light and dark 
gray, respectively). From helix II, another helix (helix I) continues in which one strand 
is formed by nucleotides from the conserved 5 ′  - primer binding site. In all sequences 
containing the motif, the 5 ′  - terminal GGAG is left (formally) unpaired. The ﬁ rst G is the 
site where the tethered anthracene is attached, suggesting an important structural role of 
this tetranucleotide. The respective ends of helix I and III are connected by loops L1 and 
L2 of varying size and sequence. A small 49 - mer RNA containing this motif only (with 
the ends of helix I and III closed by stabilizing tetranucleotide loops) accelerated the 
reaction between the tethered anthracene and biotin maleimide about 18,500 - fold, con-
ﬁ rming the ﬁ ndings of sequence analysis.  11   All characterization studies that follow have

been performed on the minimal 49 - mer derived from the conserved motif, or on variants 
of this minimal ribozyme. 
 14.6.2  Overall Catalytic Properties 
 The ribozymes were selected to catalyse the Diels – Alder reaction between a covalently 
tethered anthracene and a biotinylated maleimide, which is a single - turnover format. 
However, the selected Diels – Alderase ribozymes and the minimal 49 - mer could be 
shown to accelerate C − C bond formation in a true bimolecular fashion ( in trans reac-
tion, Figure  14.4 ). 42   Substrate molecules as small as 9 - hydroxymethylanthracene and 
N - ethylmaleimide are speciﬁ cally recognized by the ribozymes, followed by conversion 
to the respective Diels – Alder products and product dissociation from the catalyst. The 
49 - mer ribozyme performs the reaction with fast multiple turnovers, and a k cat of 21  min  − 1 
was measured. Saturation type kinetics with respect to both reactants (K M,Diene  =  370  µ M, 
K M,Dienophile    =   8   mM) as well as product inhibition were observed. The  ‘ effective molar-
ity ’  as a measure for the entropic gain of the ribozyme - catalysed reaction was determined 
from the ratio k cat /k uncat  to be 6.6   M, giving a lower estimate for the rate acceleration of 
1,100 - fold. 42 
 Another characteristic feature of enzymatic catalysis was demonstrated for the Diels –
 Alderase ribozymes, namely enantioselective bond formation. While the uncatalysed

reaction produces racemic product mixtures, the ribozyme - catalysed conversion shows 
an enantioselectivity of over 95%  ee . The enantioselectivity was shown to be primarily 
dependent on the size of the substituent at the anthracene ring system, and the enantiomer 
of this ribozyme (chemically synthesized from the unnatural L - ribonucleotides) showed 
the opposite stereoselectivity (Figure  14.4 ). 42 
 14.6.3  Overall Structure of the Ribozyme 
 The three - dimensional structure of the Diels – Alderase ribozyme could be solved both in 
form of the Apo - enzyme and in complex with the Diels – Alder cycloaddition product.  43 
The molecule adopts an overall topology that resembles the greek letter lambda   λ (Figure 
 14.5 ), featuring a special kind of three - way junction. Stems II and III are co - linearly 
stacked (best seen in panel b), bridged by a zippered - up asymmetric bubble, while stem 
I is extended by two base pairs and branches off at the bubble at  ∼ 60  °  angle. In the centre 
of the molecule there is extra electron density that is not related to nucleotides and can 
be traced back to the  S ,  S  stereoisomer of the Diels – Alder product, tightly bound into a 
pocked as a single, well - deﬁ ned conformer (Figure  14.5 c). 
 The 5 ′  - GGAG tetranucleotide plays a critical role in shaping both the RNA scaffold 
and the catalytic pocket. G1 and G2 form Watson - Crick pairs with C11 and C10, while 
A3 and G4 pair with U20 and C19, thereby generating the nested pseudoknot topology 
within the RNA scaffold (dotted lines in Figure  14.5 A,  14.5 B).  ‘ Pseudoknot ’  denotes a 
secondary structure resulting from nucleotides in the loop of an RNA stem - loop structure 
with nucleotides outside of the stem - loop. The 5 ′  - terminal GGAG serves to clamp together 
the opposite sites of the asymmetric internal bubble, and the direct connection of four 
helices without interjecting spacers can impose severe strain on the system. Such an

architecture appears to be an efﬁ cient way to achieve a rather dense and stable packing 
of helical elements. 
 14.6.4  Architecture of the Catalytic Pocket 
 The catalytic pocket is wedge - shaped and bracketed by the Watson - Crick A 3 • U 20 pair 
(bottom), the U 17 • (G 2 • C 10 ) triple (upper right), and the U 8 • A 18 reverse Hoogsteen pair (left, 
Figure  14.6 ), and is lined by an intricate network of hydrogen bonds (dotted lines). The 
(former) maleimide ring is stacked over C 10 , and apparently oriented through a pair of 
hydrogen bonds involving one of its two carbonyl oxygens, while its side chain runs inside 
a hydrophobic canyon. One of the aromatic rings of the Diels – Alder product is sand-
wiched between purines G 2 and A 3 , while the other is wedged between the base and sugar 
components of A 18  and U 20  (Figure  14.5 ). The catalytic pocket, which is primarily formed 
by base edges with minimal contribution by the sugar - phosphate backbone, is accessible 
to the product from the front while a narrow oriﬁ ce is visible in the back. It should be 
noted that the catalytic pocket contains not only a cavity to accommodate the cycloaddi-
tion product but also a direction - speciﬁ c surface channel to accommodate the maleimide 
side chain, which provides a convenient explanation for the observed stereoselectivity. 
There are no Mg 2+  cations positioned within the immediate vicinity of the pocket that 
could participate in the catalytic process. 
 The structure of the free Diels – Alderase ribozyme was found to be virtually identical 
to the structure of the product complex, providing strong support for the concept of a 
preformed catalytic pocket, established by chemical probing. 44 The anthracene - RNA 
conjugate could also be crystallized, however, the anthracene module and its linker were 
found to be disordered in the crystal. The RNA mapped well with the other crystal 
structures.

 14.6.5  Interactions Between the Ribozyme and its Substrates and Products 
 The crystallographic information about the architecture of the catalytic pocket could be 
compared with an earlier study that elucidated the interactions of the ribozyme with its 
substrates and products by chemical substitution analysis using 44 different, systemati-
cally varied analogues.  45   In that study, RNA - diene interaction was found to be governed 
by stacking interactions, while hydrogen bonding and metal ion coordination appeared to 
be less important. The diene has to be an anthracene derivative, and substituents at deﬁ ned 
positions are permitted, thereby shedding light on the geometry of the binding site (Figure 
 14.7 ). The crystal structure shows that there in no space to accommodate substituents at 
positions 2, 3, 6 and 7 (shown in outline letters), as these would clash into the walls of 
the catalytic pocket. Some space for small substituents is found at positions 4, 5 and 10, 
pointing towards the back of the pocket. Large substituents are tolerated at positions 1, 
8, and 9, pointing out of the pocket. Interestingly, the polyethylene glycol tether used in 
the selection does not make any contribution to binding and can be removed or shifted 
to another position (e.g., position 1) without penalty. 
 The dienophile must be a ﬁ ve - membered maleimidyl ring with an unsubstituted reac-
tive double bond. Substituents would again collide with the walls of the catalytic pocket. 
A hydrophobic side chain (alkyl or aryl) makes a major contribution to RNA binding. 
Branching is not allowed at the alpha position (next to the maleimide ring), due to steric 
clash with the walls. The ribozyme distinguishes between different enantiomers of chiral 
substrates and accelerates cycloadditions with both enantio -  and diastereoselectivity.

Molecular Encapsulation
The stereochemistry of the reaction is controlled by RNA - diene interactions. The 
RNA interacts strongly and stereoselectively with the cycloaddition products, requiring 
several structural features to be present. Strong and stereoselective product inhibition is 
observed. 45 
 The crystal structure shows three H - bonds between the reaction product and RNA. One 
that involves an ether oxygen of the polyethylene glycol tether is irrelevant for catalysis 
as the tether can be removed entirely without effect on catalysis. The other two involve 
the maleimide ’ s carbonyl oxygen and could be mechanistically meaningful. The impor-
tance of these bonds is, however, not yet completely established, and atomic mutagenesis 
is currently used to probe these interactions.  
 14.6.6  Conformational Dynamics and the Roles of Metal Ions 
 The investigation of this ribozyme ’ s kinetics, reaction mechanism and folding by con-
ventional chemical and biochemical methods revealed quite early complex relationships 
and suggested the existence of various conformational forms of this RNA molecule. 
Single - molecule ﬂ uorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments were carried 
out using dye - labeled ribozyme molecules.  46   The results show that the DAse ribozyme 
possesses three structurally different states that are distinguishable by their FRET efﬁ -
ciency distributions, the unfolded (U), intermediate (I) and folded (F) states. Mg 2+ titration 
allowed to measure changes in their equilibrium populations and to observe the collapse 
of the intermediate state. Both effects were described with a thermodynamic model, 
revealing how the F state is stabilized by successive binding of Mg 2+  ions. Furthermore, 
continuous ﬂ uctuations were observed between the I and F states on the 100   ms 
timescale. 
 To further elucidate the interactions of the Diels – Alderase ribozyme with divalent 
metal ions in solution, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was applied 
using paramagnetic manganese instead of magnesium ions.  47   Manganese ion titrations 
revealed ﬁ ve high - afﬁ nity Mn 2+  binding sites with an upper K d of 0.6  µ M. In order to 
characterize each binding site individually, EPR - silent Cd 2+  ions were used to saturate 
the other binding sites. This cadmium - induced EPR silencing showed that the Mn 2+ 
binding sites possess different afﬁ nities. In addition, these binding sites could be assigned 
to three different types, including innersphere, outersphere, and a Mn 2+ dimer.

 14.6.7  Mechanistic Considerations 
 The X - ray crystal structure of the ribozyme - product complex,  43   coupled with chemical  45 
and biochemical  44   experiments, suggests that the ribozyme should bind the diene and 
dienophile in a precisely deﬁ ned steric orientation within a wedge - shaped catalytic pocket, 
thereby facilitating the reaction by reducing translational and rotational degrees of 
freedom. The anthracene substrate could be bound by stacking interactions between G2 
and the A3 - U20 pair. The reaction requires that the maleimide substrate be stacked on 
top of the anthracene, and parallel to it, at a distance of about 3.5  Å . In this position, 
maleimide can form hydrogen bonds between its carbonyl - oxygen and the exocyclic 
amino group of G9 and the 2 ′  - OH of U17. The N - alkyl side chain can be placed within 
the hydrophobic canyon (Figure  14.8 ), which would allow the approach of the maleimide 
to the bound anthracene only from one direction, thereby providing the stereoselectivity 
of the reaction. In the transition state of the reaction, two new single - bonds are partly 
formed (bond lengths  ∼ 2.2  Å ), and the anthracene ring system is bent out of planarity to

yield an angle of about 154    ° (Figure  14.8 ), therefore further reducing the minimal unoc-
cupied space underneath the bridgehead carbons seen in the structure of the ribozyme -
 product complex. Remarkably, the transition state has near - perfect shape complementarity 
with the catalytic pocket, a feature of prime importance in antibody catalysis of the 
Diels – Alder reactions. 48,49   In addition to steric factors, both stacking and hydrogen 
bonding may contribute the energetics of the reaction. Stacking of the anthracene with 
nucleotides A3 and U20 could accelerate the reaction by increasing the diene ’ s electron 
density, while hydrogen bonding of the maleimide would make it more electron - deﬁ cient, 
thereby increasing catalytic reactivity. Thus, it appears that ribozyme - based catalysis of 
Diels – Alder reactions reﬂ ects a combination of proximity, shape complementarity, and 
energetic contributions to the catalytic process. 
 The catalytic parameters of the Diels – Alderase ribozymes were analyzed by Houk 
and coworkers and were found to compare favorably with those of catalytic Diels –
 Alderase antibodies, cyclodextrins, and synthetic capsules.  50   From the measured param-
eters, these authors concluded that most of the rate acceleration arises from the conversion 
of a second - order reaction of diene and dienophile into a ﬁ rst - order reaction of the 
termolecular complex ribozyme, diene, and dienophile, and calculated an extra transi-
tion state stabilization (relative to the ground state) of only  − 1.1  kcal  mol  − 1 , which is 
an order of magnitude lower than typical values for natural (protein) enzymes. 
Computational analysis of the ribozyme - catalysed Diels – Alder reaction by Zhang and 
Bruice using QM/MM methods conﬁ rmed the concerted nature of the cycloaddition 
and found that the proﬁ ciency of the RNA - catalysed reaction originates from the active 
site holding the two reactants in reactive conformations, in which the reacting atoms 
are brought together in van der Waals distances and reactants approach each other at 
an appropriate angle.  51 
 14.7  Conclusion 
 Despite their limited set of functional groups, ribozymes can accelerate complex organic 
transformations like Diels – Alder reactions between small molecules in a way similar to 
protein enzymes or supramolecular catalysts featuring multiple turnover, substrate 
speciﬁ city and stereoselectivity. The three - dimensional structure shows striking similari-
ties with proteins evolved for similar reactions, and the catalytic strategies used appear 
to be similar as well.

 15.1  Introduction 
 The catalysis of reactions in organized media is of current interest.  1 – 5 The compartmen-
talization of reagents within nanosized aggregates results in a sharp increase in their local 
concentrations (the concentration factor) and affects their microenvironment (the micro-
environment factor), thereby inﬂ uencing their reactivity. Since 1980 we have been study-
ing nucleophilic substitution at phosphorus and carbon in organized solutions based on 
surfactants. The transfer of phosphoryl and carbonyl groups is one of the most fundamen-
tal chemical and biochemical reactions.  6   Phosphorus acid esters are compounds with 
interesting biological and pharmacological properties and are widely used as pesticides, 
drugs, and nerve gases.  7   Their accumulation and their impact on the environment are of 
paramount importance, therefore chemical decontamination of toxic compounds is of 
increasing interest. 
 At ﬁ rst, the catalytic effect of the single micellar solutions based on surfactants of dif-
ferent structure was studied. The data covering this period are reviewed in refs.  8,9 The 
regularities when generalized made it possible to proceed with the more complicated 
systems, in particular, the binary surfactant solutions, the polymer - surfactant and 
polymer - cyclophane (calixarene, pyrimidinophane, and etc.) systems. For these systems, 
the terms supramolecular systems (ensembles, compositions, complexes) are further used,

since they can cover ensembles of different morphology formed through diverse noncova-
lent interactions of both intra -  and intermolecular nature, as well as through inclusion 
interactions involving the cyclophane cavity. In these systems structural transitions 
induced by changes in solution conditions (concentration, temperature, ionic force, pH, 
and etc.) are observed. Along with the above factors of concentration and microenviron-
ment these structural transitions can affect the reaction rate. Therefore the investigation 
of the catalytic effect of the polycomponent systems requires knowledge of the structural 
behaviour of the systems, in particular, packing modes, morphology of aggregates, surface 
potential, etc. 
 15.2  The Single Micellar Systems: Factors of Concentration and 
Micellar Microenvironment 
 The physico - chemical fundamentals of micellar catalysis and quantitative evaluation of 
basic factors responsible for rate alteration in organized media were developed by Berezin 
et al.  1,10   Within the frame of pseudo phase approach, the micellar solution is assumed to 
consist of micellar and bulk pseudo phases, with reagents partitioned between them. In 
general, reaction occurs in both pseudo phases simultaneously. For the case of bimolecu-
lar reactions the observed rate constant can be expressed as follows:

where   ′
kobs is the second order rate constant obtained by the division of the observed 
pseudo ﬁ rst rate constant (k obs ) by the total nucleophile concentration; k 2,0  is the second 
order rate constant of the reaction in the water; k m (=  k 2,m /V) represents the reactivity 
in the micellar phase where the reaction occurs; K s  and K Nu  are binding constants of 
substrate and nucleophile; C is the total surfactant concentration minus the critical 
micelle concentration (cmc) of the surfactant mixture. The approach developed by 
Berezin makes it possible to differentiate the factors responsible for the micellar effects, 
i.e. the micellar microenvironment factor (F m ) and the factor of the concentrating of 
reagents in micelles (F c ). 
 Different modiﬁ cations of the pseudo phase model and their applications for quantita-
tive treatment of kinetics of bimolecular reactions are reviewed by Bunton and Romsted.  2,3 
A wide variety of ion - molecular reactions has been covered in these comprehensive 
reviews, and a generalization was drawn on the prevalent contribution of the concentrating 
of reagents to the rate effect and negative inﬂ uence of micellar microenvironment on 
reactivity. Our systematic investigations of the kinetics of basic hydrolyses of phosphorus 
acid esters in aqueous and organic solutions of ionic surfactants of different structure 
showed that the above tendency of a decrease in the reactivity on the transfer of the reac-
tion from the bulk pseudo phase to the micellar interior is only typical for the systems 
with effective binding of reagents. In fact, this is observed for the reactions involving 
hydrophobic compounds and occurring in aqueous solutions of surfactants with effective 
micellization capacity. In this case, the k obs – [surfactant] kinetic dependences demonstrate 
a marked maximum. Most kinetic data reviewed in ref.  2,3   are related to these systems. 
Indeed, investigations of the basic hydrolyses of phosphonates  1 – 11 (Scheme  15.1 ) in

aqueous solutions of cationic surfactants, in particular cetyltrimethylammonium bromide 
(CTAB) 11   and cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB)  12   have revealed that the factor of concen-
tration reached two orders of magnitude, while the transfer of the reaction to the micellar 
microenvironment resulted in a marked decrease in the reactivity of the phosphonates 
(Table  15.1 ). 
 The transfer from CTAB and CPB (cmc 0.00085   M) to dodecylpyridinium bromide 
(DDPB; cmc 0.018   M) results in a marked increase in the F m  value for substrate  1 , fol-
lowed by changes from the extremum type of kinetic dependences to S - shaped curves.  11 
While in the case of the more hydrophobic substrate  3  in the DDPB micellar solution, 
the maximum type kinetic curve and the negative effect of the micellar microenvironment 
(F m  <  1) are preserved (Table  15.1 ). 
 The investigation of the kinetics of the solvolysis of  p - nitrophenyl bis(chloromethyl)
phosphinate  12  in the direct micelles of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) in ethylene glycol 
have demonstrated that the ratio of the factors F c  and F m  in this system differ from that 
in aqueous micelles, namely, the positive predominant contribution of the factor of micro-
environment to the micellar rate effect is observed (Table  15.1 ).  13   In the solution of 
ethylene glycol the micellization is much less effective as compared to the aqueous solu-
tion (cmc of SDS in ethylene glycol is equal to 0.18   M, while in water it is 0.0085   M) 
and the micelles formed have low aggregation numbers, a loose structure and a weak 
solubilization capacity (the binding constants of substrates are lower by two orders of 
magnitude as compared to those in aqueous micellar solutions). 13 
 The tendency of decreasing the contribution of the concentration factor and increasing 
the contribution of the factor of the micellar microenvironment is also observed for the 
reverse nonaqueous micellar solutions. For the case of aminolysis of phosphonates  1 – 4 
in the polyethylene glycol - 600 - monolaurate (PM) reverse micelles, both factors are 
shown to contribute positively to the micellar rate effect, with F m  higher than F c (Table 
 15.1 ). 14,15   In nonaqueous systems micellization is mainly contributed by dispersion inter-
actions and results in the formation of small aggregates with a low solubilization capacity 
towards the substrates. 16 
 In work, 11   the mechanism of the alteration of the reactivity in direct micelles is inves-
tigated. The kinetics of hydrolyses of phosphonates  1  and  3  in the DDPB micellar solution 
is measured at different temperatures and the activation parameters of the reaction, the 
enthalpy of activation and the entropy of activation in water in the absence of a surfactant 
( ∆H0
≠,   ∆S0
≠) and in the micellar pseudo phase (  ∆H0
≠,   ∆S0
≠) are estimated. The transfer of 
the ion - molecular reactions from water to the less polar pseudo phase is shown to result 
in some decrease in the enthalpy of activation (from 46.2 to 39. 3   kJ   mol  − 1  for  1  and from 
40.8 to 30.0  kJ  mol  − 1  for  3 ). This is in line with the Ingold – Hughes principle postulating

that a decrease in the polarity, in particular on transfer from water to the micellar micro-
environment should favour ion - molecular reactions since they are characterized by some 
delocalization of the charge in the transition state as compared to the initial state. 
Concurrently the transfer from the dilute aqueous solution of reagents to the concentrated 
micellar pseudo phase is followed by a decrease in the entropy of activation by 
22.0  J  mol  − 1  K  − 1  for  1 and by 45.6  J  mol  − 1  K  − 1  for  3 , which is probably due to losses in the 
entropy of mixing, the decrease in the degree of the freedom of reagents, and the altera-
tion of their orientation. In the case of substrate  1 , changes in enthalpy and entropy of 
activation compensate each other, so that the reactivity is practically identical in both 
pseudo - phases (F m    =   1, Table  15.1 ). An increase in the concentration effect for substrate 
 3  results in greater losses in the entropy of activation exceeding the gain in the enthalpy 
of activation, which is expressed in the apparent failure of the Ingold – Hughes principle 
(F m  <    1, Table  15.1 ). Therefore, one can conclude that the reactivity in the micellar 
systems is controlled by changes in the entropy of activation on the transfer of the reac-
tion from the bulk solution to the micellar interior.  
 15.3  The Role of the Structural Factor in Supramolecular 
Catalytic Systems 
 15.3.1  The Inﬂ uence of the  ‘ Sphere – Rod ’ Micellar Transition on the Reactivity 
 The addition of electrolytes to the ionic micellar systems decreases the surface potential 
of micelles thereby decreasing the catalytic effect.  1 – 3,8,9   Besides such  ‘ trivial ’ inhibition, 
electrolytes may exert an indirect inﬂ uence on the reaction rate in micellar systems. At a 
certain concentration of counterions there occurs the  ‘ sphere – rod ’  micellar transition, 
which is analytically indicated by the break in the  ‘ property ’  versus  ‘ logarithm of the 
counterion concentration ’ plot (Figure  15.1 ) 17 – 19  . Changes in the structural characteristics 
as a result of this transition may also affect the reactivity of compounds in micelles. To 
verify this assumption, the catalytic properties in parallel with the structural behaviour 
are studied for the DDPB micelles in the presence of sodium salicylate.  19 The treatment 
of the kinetic data of basic hydrolysis of  1  in semi - logarithmic coordinates provides the 
critical concentration of sodium salicylate (NaSal)  ∼ 0.05  M deﬁ ned as a break point in 
the  k obs  –  lg C Sal  plot. The size and shape of the micelles are estimated by the methods of 
 1 H NMR spectroscopy based on the self - diffusion coefﬁ cients of DDPB and EPR spec-
troscopy based on the correlation time of spin - label rotation. Near the concentration of 
0.05   M a change is shown to occur from a spherical to a rod - like shape of aggregates.  19 
This provides evidence for the correlation between the above break points on the kinetic 
plot and the micellar  ‘ sphere – rod ’  transitions, and hence, for the inﬂ uence of these struc-
tural rearrangements on the reactivity. This approach is used for the treatment of the salt 
effect on the structural behaviour and catalytic effect of the conventional cationic sur-
factants CTAB and CPB, as well as gemini cationic surfactants and the hydroxyalkylated 
single - head cationic surfactants. 18,20,21

is manifested by the sharp increase in the conductivity of the systems by three - four

orders of magnitude with an increase in the temperature or in volume fraction of the 
dispersed phase.  22 In works, 23 – 25 the inﬂ uence of this phenomenon on the reactivity of 
 1 in the sodium bis(2 - ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) - n - alkane - water reverse micellar 
system was studied with different parameters Z   =   [alkane]/[AOT] (mol) and W = [H 2 O]/
[AOT] (mol) (Figure  15.2 ). Based on the data of the conductivity of solutions, the values 
of the temperature of the percolation threshold are estimated and the experimental condi-
tions for the kinetic runs below and above the temperature induced percolation are 
chosen. 
 Unlike aqueous solutions, a typical Arrhenius dependence for the reverse systems is 
maintained only before a certain critical temperature (T cr ), while above this temperature 
a decrease in  k obs  occurs with temperature. The value of T cr  is found to coincide with the 
percolation threshold temperature. 24 We assume that the same temperature induced struc-
tural changes of the reverse micelles are responsible for the clustering of the reverse

micelles as well as for the change in the slope of the Arrhenius plot. Probably, the above 
structural changes can be accompanied by the alteration in the properties of the micellar 
microenvironment of reagents, such as micropolarity, the surface potential, and etc., 
which can affect the reactivity. The investigation of the absorption spectra of substrate  1 
and the products of its hydrolysis validated that the relocation of these compounds towards 
the less polar microenvironment occurred above the percolation threshold. Granting this, 
the effect of the temperature on the chemical kinetics in the reverse micellar systems can 
be divided into two contributions. One is responsible for the standard temperature activa-
tion of chemical processes, while the other accounts for the change in the localization of 
reagents and their partition between phases due to modiﬁ cation of the properties of aggre-
gates. The typical trend of the Arrhenius dependence below the percolation threshold T cr 
(Figure  15.2 ) provides evidence that the ﬁ rst contribution is prevalent. In this case the 
slope of the lg  k obs  vs . 1/T plot is determined by the energy of the activation (E a ) of basic 
hydrolysis of  1 . Above the T cr  value the competitive tendency is probably predominant. 
Therefore the trend of the Arrhenius dependence is determined by the change in the local

properties of the microenvironment of reagents with temperature. In this range, a decrease 
in  k obs occurs with temperature. 
 15.3.3  The Hydrolysis of Carbonic Acid Esters in Microemulsions under 
Phase Inversion Conditions 
 Microemulsions with high surfactant concentrations provide a wide - range variation in the 
component ratio, which can result in essential changes in their structural behaviour and 
properties, in rearrangements of the interface, and in phase inversions. As a result, transi-
tions become possible between three different phases: (i) reverse microemulsions (water/
oil; w/o) composed of water microdroplets dispersed in a continuous oil phase and sta-
bilized by the surfactant monolayer including a co - surfactant if necessary; (ii) bicontinu-
ous systems with both water and oil as continuous phases and surfactant molecules 
intertwined in a three - dimensional network; (iii) direct microemulsions (oil/water; o/w) 
composed of the oil microdroplets dispersed in a continuous aqueous phase. 26 
 Basic hydrolyses of  p - nitrophenyl acetate  13  and laurate  14  are studied in the CTAB/
butanol/hexane/water system under the phase transitions induced by changes in the water/
oil ratio.  27 – 30   The structural behaviour of the systems is examined by methods of conduc-
tometry, NMR self - diffusion, EPR spine probe spectroscopy, UV - Vis solvatochromic 
probe E T (30) spectroscopy. This makes it possible to characterize some micro -  and mac-
roscopic properties of the systems and to deﬁ ne the points of phase transitions in the series 
w/o - bicontinuous - o/w microemulsions. The dependence of the observed rate constant on 
the volume fraction of water in microemulsions also demonstrated three different regions 
with boundaries coinciding with the above structural transitions in the systems.  28 The 
character of the  k obs  vs .  ‘ water fraction ’  dependence is mainly inﬂ uenced by the local 
medium polarity and the activity of hydroxide - ions. In the w/o microemulsion at low 
water content, the bound water (hydrated water) is predominantly present in the micellar 
core. When the water core increases, there appears the bulk water with a higher polarity, 
which favors the dissociation processes and increases the activity of hydroxide ions. This 
results in the increase in the  k obs  value. In a bicontinuous system an increase in  k obs  is less 
pronounced, since the aqueous phase is concentrated in narrow channels thereby prevent-
ing the growth of the volume fraction of water. Besides, the considerable increase in 
microviscosity also contributes to the observed rate constants of the hydrolysis as a dif-
fusion term. Further, the transition  ‘ bicontinuous  – o/w ’  system results once again in a 
sharp increase in the reaction rate with the dispersion phase volume. Water is assumed 
to regulate the partition of butanol between phases, retaining constant its concentration 
in the dispersion phase, which is supported by the data of NMR self - diffusion. 27 This 
decreases the content of butanol at the interface increasing the positive charge density of 
aggregates and the surface concentration of hydroxide - ions.

polyoxyethylene(23)monododecyl ether (Brij - 35), polyoxyethylene(9)monotetradecyl 
ether (C 14 E 9 ), polyoxyethylene(9.5)mono - 4 - isooctylphenyl ether (Triton - X - 100) exhibit-
ing a wide range of hydrophilic - lipophilic balance and micellizating properties (cmc of 
the surfactants above are equal to 0.000017, 0.00031, 0.000052, 0.00022  M). 
 The micellization of binary surfactant solutions is studied by the method of tensiometry 
at the variation of the fraction of ionic surfactant   α 1  within the range 0 – 1.0. The quantita-
tive treatment of the surface tension isotherms within the framework of the phase separa-
tion model  36   showed that the values of the interaction parameter   β  in these systems lay 
within the range ( − 0.85) – ( − 4.6). This indicates that in these systems synergetic behaviour 
occurs, i.e. the mixed aggregates are formed. The surface potential is calculated for all 
the systems. A decrease in the potential is shown to occur with a decrease in   α 1 . 31,32,34 In 
the single CTAB micelles, up to a 20 - fold acceleration of the hydrolysis of  1  is observed. 
The nonionic Brij - 97 31 and C 14 E 9 34   micelles do not inﬂ uence the reaction rate, while the 
Brij - 35 35 and Triton - X - 100 33 micelles retard the reaction by 3 – 5 times. 
 Figure  15.3 shows that a decrease in the fraction of ionic surfactant   α 1 results in a 
decrease in the catalytic effect. In the case of the Brij - 35 and Triton - X - 100 micelles

 Scheme 15.2   The structures of pyrimidinophanes and their acyclic analogues  
an inversion from the catalysis to the inhibition of the processes occurs. At a certain 
concentration of Brij - 35 in the mixture actually an absolute termination of the reaction 
is observed. The elucidation of the main factors responsible for the alteration of the 
reaction rate in micelles, i.e. the factor of concentration (F c ) and the factor of micro-
environment (F m ) (Table 1, the data are exempliﬁ ed by the CTAB/C 14 E 9 system 34 ) makes 
it possible to derive the driving force of the catalysis in binary systems. The compensa-
tory change of the F c  and F m  values occurs within the whole range of the surfactant 
ratio. However, with small additives of nonionic surfactants, an increase in the factor 
of the micellar microenvironment is a prevalent tendency, controlling the increase of 
the resulting catalytic effect. Further decrease in   α 1  results in the inversion of the trend, 
so that an increase in F c  is accompanied by a decrease in F m  (Table  15.1 ). In these 
surfactant mixtures, the contribution of the negative inﬂ uence of the factor of micellar 
microenvironment remains dominating, which provides reasons for the reduction of the 
catalytic efﬁ ciency. Thus, the catalytic effect of the binary surfactant systems is deter-
mined by the tendency of changing the factor of micellar microenvironment throughout 
the 
whole 
surfactant 
proportions. 
This 
indicates 
that 
unlike 
surfactant - 
electrolyte systems,  17 – 19   the surface potential controlling the concentration factor plays 
only an auxiliary role in mixed micelles.

 15.5  Polycomponent Catalytic Systems Based on Amphiphiles 
and Polymers 
 15.5.1  The Conventional Surfactant/Polyethyleneimine Systems 
 Since the self - organized catalytic systems are considered to be the simplest models of 
enzyme catalysts,  1 – 3   we made an effort to model one of the basic principles of biocatalysis, 
namely, the polyfunctional mechanism of the enzyme action. Therefore, the main idea is 
to design the polycomponent catalytic ensembles by including ingredients with their own 
catalytic, sorption or solubilizing activities. For this purpose the step - by - step complication 
of supramolecular systems is carried out beginning with the aqueous polyethyleneimine 
(PEI) solution. The components of supramolecular systems were chosen in accordance 
with the following: PEI is known to accelerate the hydrolysis of phosphorus acid esters 
via the general basic catalysis.  40   Besides, it contributes to the catalysis of the reaction due 
to the sorption of reagents and to the formation of the catalytic complex substrate - 
polymer. The addition of a surfactant or other self - assembling amphiphiles to the systems 
opens up additional opportunities for binding the reagent due to the solubilization mecha-
nism together with the sorption pattern. The modiﬁ cation of the system with metal ions 
makes possible the contribution of the electrophilic catalysis to the catalytic mechanism, 
since a considerable acceleration of nucleophilic substitution at phosphorus by metal ions 
is well known. 6,41 
 15.5.1.1  The Single  PEI Solution 
 There is much evidence that the amines including polyamines accelerate hydrolyses of 
phosphorus acid esters via the general basic catalysis.  40,42   In the unbuffered solution, a 
small amount of protonated amino groups are present in the PEI molecules ( < 0.5 – 5.0% 
depending on the PEI molecular mass  43  ; PEI with the molecular mass from 800 (PEI - 800) 
to 60000 (PEI - 60) were studied). This means that under these conditions PEIs behave as 
neutral polymers rather than polyelectrolytes. The pH kinetic proﬁ le demonstrates that 
up to pH 9.2 the observed rate constant of hydrolyses of  1  and  3  in 0.05   M solution of 
PEI - 50 does not exceed the limits of 5    ×  10  − 5 s  − 1 , while a further increase in the pH results 
in a  ca . tenfold increase in the hydrolysis rate of both phosphonates.  43 This pH depend-
ence is rather typical and reﬂ ects the growth of the rate constant in the ﬁ eld of accumula-
tion of catalytic species, namely nonprotonated amino groups. In addition, the contribution 
of basic hydrolysis to  k obs values at high pH should also be taken into account. 
 To elucidate the inﬂ uence of the molecular mass of the polymer on reactivity, the 
kinetics of the hydrolyses of phosphonates  1  and  3  was measured in the presence of 
ethylenediamine (ED), tetraethylenetetramine (TETA), PEI - 800, PEI - 25, and PEI - 50 at 
spontaneous solution pH equal to 10.0 – 10.8 depending on the molecular mass of the 
PEI. 43   For all the systems studied, an increase in  k obs  with the amine concentration occurs 
due to general basic catalysis. Starting from TETA the curves are S - shaped, which is in 
line with the preliminary equilibrium process such as the formation of the catalytic 
complex substrate - polymer. Therefore, the reagent binding by oligomerous and polymeric 
amines provides an additional contribution to the rate effect. An increase in molecular 
mass of amines results in a slight increase in the catalytic effect per amino group. The 
nature of substrate does not strongly affect the reactivity. Some higher  k obs  values were 
found for the less hydrophobic phosphonate  1 .

 15.5.1.2  The  SDS / PEI Supramolecular Systems 
 In works, 43,44   the self - organization is studied in the binary SDS/PEI systems by methods 
of tensiometry, conductometry, viscosimetry, potentiometry and dynamic light scattering. 
A marked decrease in cmc is observed when transferred from the single SDS solution 
(cmc 0.0085   M) to the SDS/PEI system (critical aggregation concentration (cac) 
0.00065  M, the data for PEI - 25 43 ), which provides evidence for the formation of the 
mixed surfactant - polymer ensembles. In the SDS/PEI - 30 systems the kinetics of hydro-
lyses of phosphonates  1 ,  3 ,  5  is studied under the variation of the molecular mass of 
polymer. 44   The acceleration of the reactions is observed as compared to the aqueous 
PEI solution. The reactivity of substrates decreases in the series  1  >  3  >  5 . The same 
tendency occurs in the alkali water solution and in the single PEI system. The  k obs  vs . 
[SDS] kinetic curves demonstrate an extreme type dependence unlike those in single 
PEI solutions. The kinetic curves with a maximum are typical for micellar catalysis 
and indicate the essential contribution of the solubilization pattern to the mechanism 
of reagent binding together with the sorption pattern involved in the single PEI solution. 
In the SDS/PEI system the higher reactivity is observed for the less hydrophobic sub-
strate  1  as compared to  3 . The rate effect is shown to be due to concentrating the 
reagents in the polymer - colloid complexes for all the systems studied (Table  15.1 ). To 
elucidate the structuring role of PEI and contribution of the polymer catalysis to the 
summary rate effect, the kinetics of the hydrolyses of phosphonates  1  and  3  was exam-
ined in the micellar SDS solution in the presence of ED. In this case, a more than 
2 - fold retardation of the reaction occurs. Such a difference in the catalytic effect of 
monomeric and polymeric amines supports the above assumption that both the general 
basic catalysis and binding the substrates by the PEI molecules contribute to the accel-
eration of the reaction. 
 For substrate  1  the kinetics of hydrolysis is measured in the SDS/PEI - 30 system at 
different temperatures,  44   and then the activation parameters for the reaction in different 
pseudo phases are calculated. For micellar pseudo - phase the enthalpy of activation

 are calculated, 
which are in agreement with the bimolecular mechanism of the reaction. These values 
differ little from the activation parameters obtained for the reaction in the aqueous pseudo -

). This probably provides evidence 
that the mechanism of catalysis remains unchanged when the process is transferred from 
water to aggregates, i.e. the general basic catalysis occurs in both cases. 
 The next stage of the study was on the kinetics of hydrolyses of  1 ,  3 and di - p - 
nitrophenyl phosphate  15  in the ternary SDS/PEI/La(III) system at spontaneous solution 
pH (pH  ≈ 8.7). 43   In this system there occurs a high performance in the reactivity of phos-
phonates and its growth. The maximum catalytic effect exceeding four orders of magni-
tude is found for the substrate  15  as compared to the single PEI solution. Comparison 
with the basic hydrolysis of  15 reveals the rate effect over six orders of magnitude. 
 15.5.1.3  The NonIonic - Surfactant/ PEI System 
 Unlike the SDS/PEI system the cmc value does not decrease markedly in the solutions 
of nonionic surfactant C 12 E 10  and Triton - X - 100 when the polymer is added. This is in line 
with the assumption on the weak afﬁ nity between the nonionic surfactant and polymers.  45 
However, as will be shown below a rather high probability occurs that the mixed nonionic

Molecular Encapsulation
surfactant/PEI aggregation does take place. In work,  46 a step - by - step investigation of the 
aggregation and catalytic effect towards the cleavage of phosphorus acid esters  1  and  3 
has been performed in the following series: the single nonionic surfactant micelles    →  the 
binary nonionic surfactant/PEI micellar system    →    the ternary nonionic surfactant/PEI/
La(III) micellar system. The single C 12 E 10  micelles do not inﬂ uence the hydrolysis rate, 
while Triton - X - 100 solutions slightly retard the reaction.  33   In the binary nonionic/PEI 
solutions there occurs the rate enhancement of hydrolyses of phosphonates  1  and  3 . For 
example, in the C 12 E 10 /PEI - 60 system 3.6 - fold and 4.7 - fold accelerations of the hydrolyses 
of  1  and  3  respectively occur as compared to the single PEI solution (Figure  15.4 a). When 
the low molecular mass amines are used instead of PEI, the  k obs  versus  surfactant concen-
tration dependence assume quite a different shape (Figure  15.4 b). Thus, provided that 
there occurs only the general basic catalysis of the hydrolysis of the phosphonates due to 
aminogroups of PEI, the inhibition of the reaction might be observed. These data provide 
evidence for the formation of a new type of aggregates as compared to the single C 12 E 10 
micelles, i.e. they are indirect arguments in favor of the fact that mixed aggregation occurs

in the nonionic surfactant/polymer system. The examination of the C 12 E 10 /PEI/La(III) 
ternary system with a polarizing microscope revealed the lyotropic mesomorphism with 
fan texture typical for the hexagonal packing. The concentration and temperature ranges 
of the hexagonal phase were determined. The ternary system is found to be an effective 
nanosized catalyst in both micellar and mesophase regions. It demonstrates the complex 
mechanism of the catalytic effect under mild conditions (25    ° C, pH  ∼ 8.0) and the substrate 
speciﬁ city towards the more hydrophobic phosphonate. A marked ( ca. 10 3 - fold) accelera-
tion of the reaction studied as compared to the basic hydrolysis of the substrates has been 
attained. 46 
 15.5.1.4  The Cationic Surfactants/ PEI Supramolecular Catalytic Systems 
 The cationic surfactant - polymer systems are much less studied than those based on 
anionic or nonionic surfactants. In works,  47,48   the catalytic effect of the cationic surfactant/
PEI systems towards hydrolyses of  1 ,  3 ,  5  and  6  is studied, in cases when the molecular 
mass of PEI and the structure of the head group of surfactants experience changes. In the 
CTAB/PEI - 10 system the acceleration of hydrolyses of all the substrates studied is 
observed. The catalytic effect depends to a great extent on the structure of phosphonates 
and varies within the interval 4 – 1500 (Table  15.1 ), with the maximum acceleration occur-
ring for phosphonate  3 . 48   The observed rate constant in the binary CTAB/PEI - 10 system 
decreases in the series  3  >  1  >  6  >  5 . In the water alkali solutions in the absence of the 
surfactant and PEI the k obs  of the basic hydrolysis changes as follows:  1  >  3  >  5  >  6 , while 
in the CTAB micellar solution with no PEI added the order is  3  >  1  >  5  >  6 . 11 These dif-
ferences in the reactivity are due to the fact that the basic factors controlling the reactivity 
in the surfactant free solutions are the electronic and steric effects of substituents at the 
reaction centre, while in the organized solutions a marked contribution to the catalytic 
effect is made by binding the reagent in nanoaggregates, which correlates with the hydro-
phobicity of compounds. The above inversion of reactivity in the pairs of substrates  1 ,  3 
and  5 ,  6  in the mixed polymer - surfactant systems as compared to aqueous basic hydrolysis 
is due to (i) the change in the mechanism of the hydrolysis in the presence of PEI, i.e. 
the transfer from the speciﬁ c to general basic catalysis and (ii) the peculiarity of the 
catalysis in constrained systems, in which the main contributor is the concentrating of 
reagents due to their binding by supramolecular ensembles. For the substrates  1 and  3 the 
inﬂ uence of substituents in aqueous and micellar pseudo phase is similar, which is evident 
from the decrease of  k 2,m  with the length of the alkyl radical at reaction centre (Table 
 15.1 ). However, there occurs a considerable increase in the binding constant of the more 
hydrophobic substrate ( k 2,m  =  0.0070 and 0.0043  M  − 1  s  − 1 ; K S  =  250 and 950  M  − 1  for  1 and 
 3  respectively), which is just responsible for the higher observed rate constants for 
phosphonate  3 . 
 In work, 47   the hydrolyses of phosphonates  1 ,  3  and  p - nitrophenyldiphenyl phosphate 
( 16 ) in the systems based on PEI - 30 and two cationic surfactants CTAB and cetyldimeth-
ylethylammonium bromide (CDAB) are studied. The nature of substrate and the structure 
of the head group is found to markedly inﬂ uence the reaction rate in these systems. The 
maximum value of the observed rate constant of  1  in the CTAB/PEI - 30 system is twofold 
higher than that in the CDAB based system, while for the phosphonate  3  k obs  is threefold 
higher in the CDAB/PEI system. These differences are controlled by the  k 2,m  values for

the substrates in both systems (Table  15.1 ). The observed rate constants of  16  are much 
lower than those for  1 and  3 , which is due to the low k 2,m value (Table  15.1 ). Unlike the 
phosphonates  1 ,  3  a little difference in the reactivity of  16  in CTAB and CDAB is 
observed. In the CDAB aqueous solutions the hexagonal liquid crystalline mesophase 
(E - phase) is formed above the concentration of 0.4   M. The kinetic study of the reactions 
when the E - phase is formed demonstrates a decrease in the observed rate constant of the 
hydrolyses of the substrates with the ordering of solution. 
 In works, 49,50   the formation of the supramolecular systems based on branched and 
hydrophobized (alkyl - substituted) PEIs is revealed in both the absence and presence 
of cationic surfactants including those with hydroxyalkylated head groups. The latter 
are capable of speciﬁ c interactions with other components of the systems, in particular, 
polymer and reagents. Hydrophobization of PEIs is found to result in a sharp increase 
in their solubilizing and catalytic efﬁ ciency. Besides, a marked increase in the catalysis 
occurs on transfer from conventional cationic surfactants to hydroxyalkylated ana-
logues. By means of the optimization of the catalytic composition and reaction con-
ditions a substantial 700 – 2000 - fold acceleration of the phosphonate  1  is reached at 
neutral pH. 50 
 15.5.2  The Pyrimidinic Surfactant Based Systems 
 In works, 51 – 53   the above step - by - step approach was extended to a new type of building 
blocks, namely pyrimidinic dimeric surfactants. The self - organization of new amphiphilic 
pyrimidinic macrocycles of dimeric structure APM - 1 and APM - 2 (Scheme  15.2 ) has been 
studied in aqueous solutions.  51   The complex examination of the APM based systems with 
the help of tensiometry, conductometry, dynamic light scattering, UV - , and NMR -
 spectroscopy provides evidence for their aggregation. Calculations based on the surface 
tension isotherms and on the packing parameter considerations (P  ∼ 1) make it possible 
to assume a lamellar packing of macrocycles when aggregating. Marked differences in 
the aggregation behaviour of APM - 1 and APM - 2 have been found. In the tensiometry 
study, the lower cmc and higher cross - section area per molecule are found for APM - 2 as 
compared to APM - 1. The additives of PEI do not exert much inﬂ uence on the cmc of 
APM - 1. A pronounced decrease in cmc and also a ca. twofold decrease in the surface 
area per molecule occur in the APM - 2/PEI systems. This can indicate the transition from 
the folded to the extended packing mode. The APM ensembles are explored as nanoreac-
tors for the hydrolyses of phosphonic acid esters. The kinetic study reveals a minor rate 
effect of the APM - 1 based systems on hydrolyses of phosphonates  1  and  3 . Opposite to 
this the acceleration of the hydrolyses of both phosphonates occurs in the APM - 2 based 
systems as compared to the uncatalyzed process. The dramatic differences in the catalytic 
activity of the two macrocycles are assumed to be underlain by the different morphology 
of aggregates. Within the APM - 2 → APM - 2/PEI → APM - 2/PEI/La(III) series, due to the 
cooperative contributions of the micellar, polymer and homogeneous catalysis an increase 
in the catalytic effect is observed from 30 times to three orders of magnitude as compared 
to the basic hydrolysis. 
 In work, 52   two dimeric pyrimidinic surfactants (DPS), acyclic analogues of APM - 1 
were synthesized: a gemini surfactant DPS - 1, and a typical bolaform surfactant DPS - 2 
(Scheme  15.2 ). The catalytic effect of the single surfactant solutions and their mixtures

with PEI towards hydrolyses of  1  and  3  was studied. They exhibit speciﬁ c aggregation 
and catalytic properties. The more hydrophobic surfactant DPS - 1 demonstrates behaviour 
typical for cationic surfactants, in particular, it shows catalytic activity towards hydrolyses 
of phosphonates, which increases with the substrate hydrophobicity. In the DPS - 2 based 
systems, a 25 - fold inhibition of the reaction occurs, with no substrate speciﬁ city. Such 
behaviour is rather unusual for a cationic surfactant. The differences in the aggregation 
and catalytic properties can be due to the differences in the packing mode between the 
DPS - 1 and DPS - 2 molecules when self - assembling. 
 Recently, new amphiphilic pyrimidinic compounds with different kinds of counterions, 
inorganic bromide anions (APB) and hydrophobic tosylate anions (APT) were synthe-
sized, 53   which showed intermediate hydrophobicity between DPS - 1 and DPS - 2. The cata-
lytic effect towards basic hydrolyses of  1  and  3  is examined. For comparison, the rate 
effect of conventional surfactants CTAB and cetyltrimethylammonium tosylate (CTAT) 
with similar counterions is studied as well. Both CTAB and APB solutions accelerate 
hydrolyses of phosphonates  1  and  3 . Surfactants with hydrophobic anions demonstrate a 
different behaviour, namely, hydrolysis of phosphonate  3 is accelerated by CTAT and 
APT micelles, while the less hydrophobic substrate  1  is retarded by the APT micelles 
unless alkali excess is used. This deviation from the typical behaviour for cationic sur-
factants is due to the decrease in solution pH with APT concentration above the cmc. 
Detailed self - organization studies by methods of tensiometry, conductometry, potentiom-
etry and NMR spectroscopy were conducted. A marked difference in the structural 
behaviour between the AP - type and conventional CTA surfactants is found: (i) for both 
pairs APB/CTAB and APT/CTAT studied the counterion binding is stronger for the 
conventional cationic surfactants as compared to dimeric pyrimidinic surfactants; (ii) 
although a structural transition is probably observed in the APT micelles at C    ≥  0.01  M, 
no sharp micellar growth occurs with the APT concentration, as distinct from the CTAT 
micelles; (iii) the cmc ’ s of dimeric surfactants are only a little lower than those of CTA 
analogues. The geometry of AP compounds may be assumed to be mainly responsible 
for the above result. A branched molecular architecture prevents the close packing of the 
monomers in the bulk solution and at the interface and produces a steric hindrance around 
the head groups. This effect can be responsible for the high surface potential, and hence 
for the decrease in solution pH due to the polarization of the hydrated water molecules 
and their further deprotonation. 
 15.5.3  The Calixarene Based Systems 
 Recently, new building blocks, in particular, amphiphilic calixarenes were explored for 
the design of polycomponent catalysts.  54 – 57   We intended testing the contribution of the 
inclusive interactions to the self - assembling of components. In works,  54,55 the aggregation 
behaviour and catalytic activity of PEI and sulfonatomethylated calix[4]resorcinarene 
(SCA) (Scheme  15.3 ) based systems are studied by methods of the NMR and UV - vis 
spectroscopy. The mixed PEI − SCA assembling is shown to occur in the concentration 
range lower than the cmc indicated by the tensiometry data (cmc   =  0.011  M) due to the 
inclusive type of the PEI − SCA interactions. Different modes of self - organization assum-
ing the PEI inclusion into the calixarene cavity are discussed: (i) the layered ensembles 
separated by the PEI chains dipped into the cavity, and (ii) the SCA molecules penetrated

with PEI of the pseudorotaxane type. The latter is in good agreement with the extensive 
NMR and calculating data for this system.  
 In the kinetic studies the step - by - step investigation of the catalytic activity towards the 
hydrolytic cleavage of phosphonate  1  and  p - nitrophenyl dimethyl phosphate ( 17 ) has been 
carried out in the single PEI system, the binary PEI/SCA system and the ternary PEI/
SCA/La(III) system. Two reaction routes of hydrolysis of  17  (the leaving of aromatic 
versus alcohol fragment) are revealed in the single PEI solution and the binary PEI/SCA 
systems by both NMR and UV - vis studies, while in the presence of La(III) only the 
departure of  p  - nitrophenolate group occurs. The addition of noncatalytic SCA to the PEI 
solution is shown to result in a tenfold acceleration of the reaction below the cmc due to 
the catalytic action of the PEI/SCA inclusive type ensembles. The ternary PEI/SCA/
La(III) system demonstrates a marked catalytic activity attaining two (for  1 ) and four (for 
 17 ) orders of magnitude due to superposition of several factors of catalysis. 
 In work, 56 the aggregation behaviour and catalytic activity of supramolecular systems 
composed of three basic components in different combinations are investigated. They are 
amphiphilic calix[4]resorcinarene CR - 1 (Scheme  15.3 ), anionic surfactant SDS and PEI -
 25, either of which is capable of self - assembling in solution and interacting through a 
 ‘ guest – host ’  mechanism. The evaluations of the size of aggregates, cloud points and cata-
lytic properties are in agreement with the assumption on the mixed aggregation in the 
systems studied. The step - by - step investigation of the catalytic effect towards hydrolyses 
of phosphonates  1  and  3  is performed in the series of supramolecular systems CR - 1/SDS; 
CR - 1/PEI; SDS/PEI; CR - 1/SDS/PEI. The change from ca. 20 - fold inhibition of the reac-
tion in ensembles of anionic amphiphiles CR - 1 and SDS to the tenfold catalysis occurs 
due to the immobilization of anionic nanoreactors at the catalytically active polymer 
matrix, PEI. The possibility for the transfer from the microheterogeneous to the hetero-
geneous system and for the separation of the catalyst and products by the cloud point 
strategy is presented.

ratio between unsubstituted and hydroxybenzylated fragments amounts to 0.3; 0.12; 0.16 
and 0.3 for PEI 1 , PEI 2 , PEI 3  and PEI 4  respectively. The formation of the mixed PEI/CTAB 
and PEI/PM ensembles are supported by dielcometric titration, dynamic light scattering, 
viscosimetry and the solubilization of  p - nitrophenol measurements. The character and 
extent of their inﬂ uence on the phosphorylation of PEIs is found to depend on the PEI/
surfactants ratio, on the component structure, and on the temperature. In the case of 
CTAB an acceleration of the reaction occurs throughout the whole concentration range 
studied, 58   while in the PEI/PM system an increase in the surfactant concentration at ﬁ rst 
results in the increase in the observed rate constant and then in its decrease.  59 The inver-
sion of the rate effect is probably due to the rearrangement of the supramolecular ensem-
bles. Indeed, the concentration range corresponding to the inhibition of the processes 
coincides with the formation of the lager aggregates (Figure  15.5 ).  59 The surfactant rate 
effects on the phosphorylation of PEI equal the ca. 6 – 7 - fold acceleration (for CTAB) or 
the inhibition of the same magnitude (for PM).  58,59   The use of the CTAB/PM mixture 
provides a marked increase in the catalytic effect, which depends on the molar ratio of 
the surfactant, reaching ca. 24 - fold acceleration.  60   The rate enhancement increases in the

series PEI 1  <  PEI 4  <  PEI 3  <  PEI 2 . The quantitative treatment of the kinetic data in terms 
of pseudo phase model demonstrates that small as it is the factor of concentration of 
reagents mainly contributes to the rate effect. Indeed, the microenvironment factor may 
vary from the negative inﬂ uence (F m  =  0.32 for PEI 1 ) to 1.0 for PEI 4 , while the concen-
tration factor F c > 1 in all cases, thereby provides the acceleration of the reaction.   
 In work, 61   the reaction of alkylated branched PEI - 10 (APEI - 10) bearing tetradecyl 
substituents (PEI 5 ) with phosphinate  12  is studied in the presence of PM in toluene. The 
 k obs  versus C PM  dependence has an extremum. A maximum twofold acceleration of 
the reaction is observed, followed by a  ca. 5 – 7 - fold inhibition with the further increase 
in the surfactant concentration. Similar to the above phosphorylation reaction, the unfa-
vorable inﬂ uence of the microenvironment and the prevalent positive contribution of the 
concentration factor occur in this system. In particular, the values F m  =  0.55 and F c  =  31.0 
are obtained when ﬁ tting the kinetic data in terms of Equation  15.1 (Table  15.1 ). 
 In work, 62   the complexation of APEI - 10 bearing  n - tetradecyl (PEI 5 , PEI 6 ) and  n - nonyl 
(PEI 7 ) radicals (the extent of substitution of 0.3; 0.6 and 0.26 respectively) with function-
alized calix[4]resorcinarenes (CR) in chloroform is revealed by methods of UV - Vis 
spectrophotometry, dielcometric titration and dynamic light scattering. The CRs alkylated 
or phosphorylated at low rim are studied (Scheme  15.3 ). The complexation of PEI and 
CR is shown to change the nucleophilicity of the polymer, which is exempliﬁ ed by the 
reaction between APEI and phosphinate  12 . 63   Based on the NMR   31  P data a conclusion 
is drawn that PEI rather than CR functions as a nucleophile towards the substrate in the 
PEI/CR/chloroform system. CR mediates this reaction as a catalytic species involved in 
the mixed aggregation. The rate effect depends on the ratio of components and their 
structure. A decrease in the hydrophobicity and increase in the extent of substitution of 
PEI result in the enhancement of the catalysis. The highest  ca.  35 - fold acceleration of the 
phosphorylation occurs at the low CR and polymer concentrations. An additional 6 – 7 - fold 
increase in the catalytic effect can be attained by the addition of surfactants. For example, 
the PEI 5 /CR - 2/CTAB - chloroform system demonstrates a 45 - fold acceleration of the reac-
tion under study. 64 
 15.6  Conclusions 
 The catalytic effect of supramolecular systems based on amphiphilic compounds of dif-
ferent structure (surfactants, hydrophobized polymers, calixarenes, pyrimidinophanes) on 
the nucleophilic substitution at phosphorus and carbon has been investigated in both 
aqueous and nonaqueous media. They demonstrate a wide - range catalytic activity from 
the deep retardation of the reactions to the multiple accelerations to the point of several 
orders of magnitude. The factors determining the rate effect have been analyzed. Two 
main points should be emphasized, i.e. (i) the crucial role of the structural factors in the 
catalysis has been revealed; (ii) the catalytic effect of polycomponent ensembles is mark-
edly inﬂ uenced by the nature of components and their ratio. This indicates that reactivity 
in supramolecular systems can be controlled by the purposeful selection of catalytic 
species and by inducing structural transition in the systems. Besides, such kind of control 
requires knowledge of the structural behaviour of the systems, in particular, packing 
modes, morphology of aggregates, surface potential, etc.

 16.1  Introduction 
 16.1.1  Vesicular Aggregates 
 Surfactants, or amphiphiles, comprise a large class of compounds, characterized by one 
(or more) ionic or highly polar headgroups and one, two, or rarely more, hydrophobic 
alkyl tails (usually  n - C 8 to  n - C 22 , the most common being C 12 , C 14 , C 16 , C 18 , and C 20 ). In 
aqueous media, above a critical concentration, these systems cope with their dual struc-
tural properties by forming aggregates in which the headgroups are in contact with water 
while the alkyl chains reside in the core of the aggregate, avoiding interactions with the 
aqueous medium. 
 A variety of different morphologies are possible for these aggregates, depending on 
the molecular structure of the single amphiphilic molecule, including their size and shape. 
But other factors like ionic strength, temperature, pressure and pH also play a role. 1 
 Vesicles (from the Latin vesicula, small bubble) belong to the most extensively studied 
amphiphilic aggregates.  2   Not only because the bilayer membrane is the building block of 
cell membranes, but also because vesicles or liposomes offer the unique possibility for 
solutes to bind to the outer -  and inner leaﬂ ets of the bilayer whereas the hydrophobic 
interior of the bilayer can be used to entrap hydrophobic solutes and also membrane 
proteins.

Molecular Encapsulation
 The Gibbs energy of a vesicle depends on a compromise of attractive and repulsive 
interactions. The main contributions come from hydrophobic interactions between the 
tails, the major driving force for aggregation, and from repulsive interactions between the 
headgroups at the aqueous interface, which, in case of ionic surfactants, are in part com-
pensated by counterion binding. This counterion binding is usually stronger for vesicles 
than for micelles.  3   Other factors also play a role, one of them being the loss of confor-
mational entropy of the hydrocarbon tails in the vesicular core. 
 Water is the essential medium for surfactant aggregation, although association can 
occasionally also occur in polar solvents with a high cohesive energy density.  4 
 Which factors determine the packing efﬁ ciency of the amphiphiles in the aggregate? 
The dimensionless shape factor or packing parameter (P) provides a relation between the 
molecular shape of the amphiphile and the preferred morphology of the aggregate in dilute 
aqueous solution at low ionic strength and at ambient temperatures:  5

 Herein, V is the volume of the hydrophobic chain, a 0  the optimal cross - sectional surface 
area of the headgroup, and l c  the length of the all -  trans  alkyl tails. It will be clear that the 
curvature of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface is related to the value of P. The rela-
tion between the aggregate morphology and P is given in Figure  16.1 . The packing 
parameter concept provides a reasonable and useful rationalization of the rich polymor-
phism of surfactant aggregates, but it has also been criticized. A signiﬁ cant issue is, of 
course, that the values of a 0  and l c  are not independent of each other.  6 Nevertheless, 
extensive studies of a large series of amphiphiles in which the structure was gradually 
modiﬁ ed showed that the approach worked satisfactorily. 7,8 
 It was Bangham who, in the sixties of the past century discovered that liposomes could 
be made from egg yolk.  9   But phospholipids are by no means unique in this behaviour. 
Kunitake 10   showed that bilayer vesicles can be obtained from synthetic surfactants in case 
0.5  <  P  <  1.0, while for P  =  1.0 a ﬂ at bilayer is formed.  11   Bilayer morphologies, usually 
preferred by double - tailed amphiphiles, are shown in Figure  16.2  and are called lamellar 
phases. The bilayer consists of two opposing layers of amphiphiles, with the aligned tails 
facing each other and the headgroups situated at the aqueous interface. In case the two 
ends of the bilayer close to form a global structure with an aqueous inner compartment, 
the aggregate is called a vesicle, or a liposome if the amphiphilic constituent is a phos-
pholipid molecule. Mammalian cell membranes may contain microdomains ( ‘ rafts ’ ) 
which can also be formed in multicomponent liposomes.  12,13   For the structures of the most 
common phospholipids in cell membranes, the reader is referred to appropriate biochem-
istry textbooks. 
 Vesicles and particularly liposomes are highly useful, although severely simpliﬁ ed, 
models for biological membranes. 
 Conventional molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of the formation of small dipalmi-
toylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes in atomistic detail (1017 DPPC molecules in 
106.563 waters) have provided mechanistic insights into some general features of lipo-
some formation.  14   In the very rapid initial stages of the aggregation process micellar - like 
structures are formed. Lipid bridging between these micelles leads to larger, lamellar 
morphologies, which are, in fact, curved bilayers. Spontaneous development of curvature, 
resulting from minimization of edge energy, is then claimed to induce formation of

liposome - like shapes. These contain water pores with diameters of 1 – 4  nm, allowing rela-
tively slow equilibration of lipid molecules between the inner and outer leaﬂ ets by diffu-
sion. This so - called  ‘ ﬂ ip - ﬂ op ’  has also been studied in mature vesicles already many years 
ago. 15   Finally these processes result in collapse of the water pores and formation of the 
most stable liposomal aggregate. 16,17 Spontaneous formation of vesicles from mixed 
amphiphiles as well as the interaction of vesicles with other molecules (including choles-
terol 18 ) has also been investigated using MD techniques. 19 
 With a few exceptions (catanionic vesicles, for example  20,21  ), vesicles are metastable 
aggregates and posses a tendency to undergo aggregation followed by merging of the 
bilayers and eventually precipitation. Therefore vesicles can be best coined as  ‘ colloidal 
structures ’ . 22   Apart from catanionic vesicles and contrary to the suggestion by some MD 
simulations,  14   closed vesicle formation from single amphiphilic molecules is not sponta-
neous but requires input of mechanical energy such as shaking, stirring, extrusion or 
sonication, inducing formation of closed vesicles from bilayer sheets and increasing the 
bilayer curvature and reducing the vesicular size. In fact, the method of vesicle prepara-
tion has an effect on the exact lamellar structure and on the vesicular size.  23,24 A bending 
energy can be deﬁ ned for formation of a closed vesicle from a bilayer sheet. The curvature 
stress energy for a bilayer can be calculated with the (simpliﬁ ed) Helfrich Gibbs energy 
equation. 25   In contrast to micelles, vesicles tend to separate from their dispersions, but 
this process may take a considerable time span (ranging from seconds to months). 
 To prove the formation of vesicles a number of indirect techniques can be used such 
as dynamic light scattering, the use of ﬂ uorescent probes and pulsed ﬁ eld gradient NMR 
self - diffusion measurements. Some more direct techniques such as freeze - fracture and 
negative staining electron microscopy are less biased by the interpretation of the scientist, 
but also these methods have their limitations. Cryo - electron microscopy, as introduced 
by Dubochet in the 80s,   26   is the method of choice when it comes to visualization of small 
colloidal structures.  27   Recent developments in the vitriﬁ cation of specimens make it now 
possible to observe vesicles and other aggregated structures artifact free. 
 Vesicles with sizes varying from nanometers to micrometers usually contain large 
numbers of surfactant molecules. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) possess diameters 
which may vary considerably (50 – 500   nm) and have a large encapsulation efﬁ ciency 
(5 – 20  l  mol  − 1 ). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with diameters of 20 – 50  nm encapsulate 
smaller volumes (0.5 – 1.0  l  mol  − 1 ) Under special conditions, giant vesicles may be formed 
(diameter in the order of 1 – 500  µ m) with a low bilayer curvature, akin to that of a ﬂ at 
bilayer. 28,29   These giant vesicles are able to eject smaller vesicles by a budding process.  30 
 In vesicles, the ﬂ uidity of the bilayer  31   and the associated stiffness and order of the 
alkyl tails can vary signiﬁ cantly as a function of temperature, but, of course, also depend-
ing on the detailed structure (straight or branched), size, and the presence of one or more 
double or triple carbon – carbon bonds in the tails. At lower temperatures, the bilayers 
reside in the gel phase (L  β  ) with the strongest packing of the all -  trans  alkyl chains and 
with the largest order and rigidity. Upon increasing the temperature, a cooperative phase 
transition occurs to the L  α   or liquid crystalline phase with a more liquid - like core, allow-
ing fast diffusion of the amphiphilic components, and in which gauche conformations 
of the alkyl tails are allowed. As expected this main phase transition temperature 
(T c ) becomes lower if the alkyl chains are shortened or if unsaturation is introduced into 
the tails.

 Sometimes an intermediate  ‘ rippled ’  phase (  P ′
β ) 32 is ﬁ rst formed from the L  β  phase, 
which transforms to the L  α   phase at higher temperatures. At still more elevated tempera-
tures, the lamellar phase may change into inverted cubic (I  β  ) or related isotropic phases.  33,34 
These highly complex aggregates have been proposed as intermediates during membrane 
fusion. A further temperature increase may lead to formation of inverted hexagonal phases 
(H II ), in which the weakly hydrated amphiphiles are packed in inverted micellar - like 
cylinders, with the headgroups facing inside and in contact with water in the enclosed 
compartment. 
 Vesicles possess many interesting potentials for applications, one of the most important 
being encapsulation of solutes, a phenomenon that has been investigated in detail and has 
been utilized in different ways. To get insight into the possibilities for encapsulation, 
unavoidably involving disturbances of the bilayer structuring and to predict which binding 
sites are available for solubilizates of different chemical composition, we can have a look 
at the lateral pressure proﬁ le, extensively investigated by Cantor. 35,36 The lateral pressure 
(LP) is deﬁ ned as d  π (z) acting within a thin slice of the bilayer with thickness dz. Positive 
values of the LP indicate repulsion, negative values stand for attraction. The lateral pres-
sure density is then given by p(z)   =   d  π /dz, with dimensions of bulk pressures. At the 
aqueous interface of the membrane, the headgroups repel each other (positive LP), 
whereas at the interface somewhat deeper into the bilayer, the tails attract each other 
through hydrophobic interactions leading to a large, negative LP. Still deeper in the 
membrane, there is little or no water and the enforced partial ordening of the tails is 
accompanied by a considerable loss of entropy due to their reduced conformational 
freedom. This means repulsion and a positive LP in the central part of the core of the 
bilayer. The variation of the LP with the depth in the membrane is an important issue and 
has been applied in detail in the ﬁ eld of bilayer - protein interactions. 37 
 Figure  16.3  shows a LP proﬁ le for one mono - layer, the proﬁ le for the opposite mono-
layer is the same. We see how the LP varies with depth in the membrane. Since the 
formation of a vesicular membrane is associated with a favorable Gibbs energy, the total 
lateral pressure in the membrane is zero (or nearly so).   
 The lateral pressure concept provides useful insight into the spatial distribution of 
forces and is a sum over terms corresponding to layers of ﬁ nite thickness (dz).  38 Quantitative 
measurements of the LP remain difﬁ cult and even the concept has been criticized. 39 
 Chain order parameters, measured by  2 H - NMR studies on amphiphiles with speciﬁ cally 
deuterium - labelled methylene units in the tails,  40 – 42   gave a similar view of the distribution 
of the chain attractions/repulsions as a function of position in the tails. Increasing quad-
rupole splittings, indicated by an increasing distance between the two peaks in the  2 H -
 NMR spectrum, are associated with increasing chain order. 
 In sum, a larger repulsion between speciﬁ c parts of the alkyl chains in a bilayer is 
reﬂ ected in a higher lateral pressure, a decrease in chain order and more area available 
for that part of the tails. Such changes can be induced by, for example, a higher tempera-
ture or introduction of a  cis C = C bond into the tail or via  trans – cis  isomerization of 
double - tailed, azobenzene - substituted amphihiles. 43 
 In recent years, several computational methods have been developed to calculate LP 
proﬁ les in membranes. Among them, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been 
particularly successful. Timescales extending to hundreds of nanoseconds are now com-
putationally feasible, but the simulations are still restricted to relatively small system

sizes. MD is also useful in studies of undulatory and thickness ﬂ uctuation modes of 
bilayers. 44 
 Finally we note that, apart from double - tailed surfactant molecules, vesicular aggre-
gates can also be formed from a number of other building blocks, including nonionic 
amphiphiles to form niosomes,  45 single - tailed surfactants 46,47   and complex (co)polymers, 
polypeptides, and dendrimers.  48   In this chapter we restrict our discussion to encapsulation 
processes by vesicles formed from synthetic surfactants and phospholipids.  
 16.1.2  Solute Encapsulation by Vesicles 
 It will be obvious that the encapsulation of a solute molecule into a vesicular membrane 
will affect the interchain interactions in the bilayer.  49   Overall, the Gibbs energy for 
binding should be negative, otherwise the solute would remain in bulk solution. Therefore, 
partitioning of a relatively apolar solute into the membrane will be most favorable at a 
location with the best balance between solubilizate - tail and solubilizate - headgroup inter-
actions on one hand and changes in tail - tail interactions on the other hand. These coun-
teracting contributions will also signiﬁ cantly depend on hydration changes. On the other 
hand, the (solvation) properties of the solubilizate are also different from those in dilute 
aqueous solution as a result of binding in the vesicular bilayer. 
 In this brief review we will describe some important encapsulation processes by vesicu-
lar aggregates. Encapsulation will be broadly interpreted. Apart from solubilization in the 
aqueous pool inside the vesicle, the term will also encompass binding of solubilizates to 
all binding sites available in the vesicular system. We will not discuss bilayer vesicles 
formed from amphiphiles further functionalized by receptor molecules, such as amphiphilic 
cyclodextrins.  50 
 Instead of a comprehensive review of the vast literature on solute encapsulation, a 
selection will be made of various illustrative binding possibilities in or at the bilayer.

Encapsulation Processes by Bilayer Vesicles 
427
Although binding to vesicles has been less extensively studied than binding to micelles, 
attempts will be made to rationalize why speciﬁ c solute molecules bind to particular 
binding locations. 
 16.1.3  Binding Locations 
 Let us now look at the different locations for spontaneous encapsulation of solutes of 
different chemical composition. First of all, it goes without saying that encapsulation 
experiments should be carried out under well - deﬁ ned conditions. Often vesicles, after 
their preparation, and subsequently after binding of the solubilizate, need time to arrive 
at their most stable conﬁ gurations (size, tail ordering) and adequate attention should be 
given to this issue. This process may sometimes take days at room temperature. Also the 
method used for their preparation may exert a deﬁ nite effect on the vesicular properties. 
Thus, for a honest comparison of encapsulation abilities, it is recommended that the vesi-
cles are prepared under exactly the same conditions and that their properties are checked 
by a proper physical technique, such as cryo - electron microscopy. Also temperature 
control needs attention since the gel and liquid - crystalline phase exhibit different binding 
efﬁ ciencies of solutes. 
 The binding locations can be charaterized as follows: 
  (a)     In the outer Stern region, where the solute interacts almost exclusively with the polar 
or ionic headgroups. In case of ionic headgroups, relatively hydrophilic solutes, car-
rying opposite charges (preferably double - charged) are the best candidates for strong 
binding. Interaction is mainly governed by electrostatic forces. Close approach 
between oppositely charged ionic moieties is necessarily accompanied by partial 
dehydration of the ions, an effect that may in part counteract the attractive 
interactions. 
 Hydrophilic solutes like carbohydrates, i.e. glucose, sucrose, and trehalose also 
bind close to the charged headgroups, replacing hydration water, as laid down in the 
 ‘ water - replacement hypothesis ’ . 51   They act as cryoprotectants and help to stabilize 
the bilayer in case of insufﬁ cient water. 
 There is now compelling evidence that selective hydrogen - bonding interactions 
between functional groups of hydrophobically - buried molecules residing near the 
vesicle - water interface are able to overcome the otherwise dominant hydrogen 
bonding to water molecules, present in high excess. A recent example is the self -
 adhesion among phospholipid vesicles carrying adhesive agents.  52 Such associations 
in the aqueous interface are largely governed by entropic factors, as discussed in a 
beautiful review.  53   The entropic costs for association of ligands tethered to the surface 
of vesicles are smaller than those for interaction of similar species diffusing independ-
ently in three dimensions in an aqueous medium. 
 A highly unexpected result, ﬁ rst reported in 2003, was the efﬁ cient adsorption of 
hydroxide ions at pH values slightly above 7.5 to (almost) uncharged hydrophobic 
surfaces 54   and vesicular surfaces formed by reduced - sugar based gemini surfactants.  55,56 
The origin of this phenomenon has been investigated in some detail. 57

hydrated alkyl tails through hydrophobic interactions. Often these solutes also possess 
a hydrophilic substituent, necessary for sufﬁ cient water solubility, and this substituent 
will be preferentially directed towards the more aqueous region of a bilayer for ben-
eﬁ cial contact with water. Incorporation of solutes may disturb the tail – tail interac-
tions to some extent. An example is provided by the anchoring of hydrophobically 
modiﬁ ed poly(sodium acrylate)s into di -  n  - dodecylphosphate (DDP) vesicles. In case 
the polymer contains  n  - dodecyl chains, the bilayer is hardly affected as indicated by 
detailed DSC measurements. By contrast, for  n - nonyl and  n - octadecyl chains the 
hydrophobic mismatch leads to lower main phase transition temperatures and reduced 
enthalpies of transition per mole of DDP monomer. Another notable consequence of 
binding of the hydrophobically modiﬁ ed polymer into the vesicle bilayer is the 
increase of the cooperativity of the melting process, probably resulting from the pres-
ence of larger  ‘ patches ’  with a lower curvature.  58   Another interesting effect induced 
by hydrophobic mismatching is the clustering of membrane proteins in case their 
hydrophobic transmembrane domains do not match with the surrounding lipid 
bilayer. 59 
 Interestingly, transvesicular reactions between substrates bound in the exovesicular 
and endovesicular leaﬂ ets have been studied, particularly at relatively low vesicular 
ﬂ uidities. 60 
  (c)     Deep in the interior of the bilayer. These are the preferred binding locations for 
strongly hydrophobic molecules. The chain order is relatively low in this region and 
the LP is positive. There is also more free volume available for incoming hydrophobic 
solutes. These binding processes will affect bilayer dynamics. 
 It has recently been shown that introduction of a small, hydrophobic molecule like 
isoprene may lead to a more ordered and better packed lipid membrane as revealed 
by MD simulations. The stabilized membrane is then protected against temperature -
 induced disordering of the tails.  61   Similar thermoprotective effects are induced by 
cholesterol which also increases the molecular packing of the tails and, in contrast to 
isoprene, affects the dynamics of the lipids in the bilayer. 62 
  (d)     In the aqueous inner compartment of the vesicle. Sufﬁ ciently hydrophilic solutes can 
be entrapped in the aqueous medium inside the vesicular system and may favourably 
interact with the headgroups stacking into this medium.  63   In contrast to the protocols 
used for binding at the sides labelled (a) – (c), binding in the water pool is realized by 
preparation of the vesicle dispersion in a medium already containing the solute. 
During the formation of the vesicular aggregate, the solute becomes entrapped in the 
inner aqueous compartment. Of course, a prerequisite for this type of encapsulation 
is that leakage over the bilayer is slow. Carboxyﬂ uorescein, a highly water - soluble 
ﬂ uorescent dye, has been extensively used to probe leakage over vesicular bilayers. 63 
Strong bilayer packing, as induced by encapsulated cholesterol, slows down leakage 
processes. 
 Finally, we stress that the bound solutes are often certainly not localized at a single, 
precisely deﬁ ned, position but may exchange rapidly between various positions of 
similar binding characteristics and partition coefﬁ cients. 
 As we will discuss below, microencapsulation offers interesting possibilities for reac-
tivity control. 64

Encapsulation Processes by Bilayer Vesicles

 16.1.4  Experimental Techniques for Measuring Encapsulation Processes 
 It is obvious that binding of a solute to a vesicle will induce changes in the physical 
properties of both solute and the amphiphilic molecules that make up the bilayer aggre-
gate. Two sorts of information can be obtained from these changes. First, the strength of 
the interaction, which can be quantiﬁ ed by the solvent/bilayer partition coefﬁ cient of the 
solute. Second, in many cases information can be obtained regarding the location of the 
binding site although the exact interpretation of the experimental data can be quite chal-
lenging. Both types of data are of immediate importance for applications of the particular 
vesicular aggregates. 
 A brief summary will now follow of some of the most frequently employed experi-
mental techniques. Several of these have been particularly applied for micellar aggregates, 
but their usage can often be easily extended to vesicles. 
 16.1.4.1  Microcalorimetry 
 The greatly improved sensitivity of the modern microcalorimeters for both differential 
scanning microcalorimetry (DSC) and isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) has 
made their application highly useful. Titration microcalorimetry yields binding constants 
and, when applied as a function of temperature, full thermodynamic details for the binding 
process. 65   DSC provides details about the disturbance of the bilayer system by the solu-
bilized guest from which conclusions may be drawn about the preferred binding 
locations. 
 16.1.4.2  NMR Spectroscopy 
 Ring current effects have already been examined more than twenty years ago and indi-
cated which groups are in close proximity to an aromatic ring in the solute or in the 
amphiphile. This is useful information but the exact positioning of these interaction sites 
within the bilayer may remain a problem.  66,67   Nuclear Overhauser effects have also been 
employed frequently. 
 Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments measure the distribution coefﬁ -
cients of solubilizates.  68,69   A comparison is made between the proton spin – lattice relaxa-
tion rates of the solubilizate in the absence and presence of noncomplexing paramagnetic 
ions of the same sign of charge as the headgoups. Such paramagnetic ions reside neces-
sarily in the bulk solvent and their effect on the nuclei of the solubilizate depend on the 
efﬁ ciency of penetration of the solubilizate into the core of the bilayer. The method is 
applicable for a variety of NMR - active nuclei in the guest molecule. These results can be 
compared with those obtained from Fourier transform pulsed gradient spin - echo NMR 
self - diffusion measurements. 
 16.1.4.3  Phosphorescence, Fluorescence and Steady - state Absorption Techniques 
 These techniques can be employed for quantitative studies of the distribution constants 
of solubilizates as well as for measuring the kinetics of solubilization. Binding at the 
surface or in the core of the aggregate can be distinguished under favorable conditions 
by ﬂ uorescence probing. 70 – 72

Molecular Encapsulation
 Solvatochromic probes like Nile Red allow characterization of temperature - dependent 
phase transitions. This is possible due to the large difference in polarity between the 
ground and excited state of the probe.  73   At binding sites of signiﬁ cantly different polarity 
the probe exhibits selective excitation properties and excitation - dependent emission 
maxima. 
 16.1.4.4  Combined Fluorescence Quenching Experiments and 
Paramagnetic Resonance 
 Data obtained by this technique allow rather detailed conclusions about the location of 
the solubilizate in the aggregate. Fluorescence quenching rate constants vary with tem-
perature, local microviscosity and quencher concentration.  74 – 76   Encapsulation of spin 
probes has been examined in detail by EPR spectroscopy.  77 
 16.1.4.5  Cryo - Electron Microscopy 
 Apart from (bio - )chemical data, direct structural information of vesicles and micelles can 
be obtained by cryo - electron microscopy. Cryo - electron microscopy as introduced by 
Jaques Dubochet, 26 has now become a standard technique to gain artifact - free structural 
information within the natural solvent. In most cases water   78   is used but also other sol-
vents like polar organic solvents  79   and apolar solvents  80   can be employed. Thin layers of 
solvent with colloidal suspended material can be vitriﬁ ed by rapid cooling in liquid 
ethane. By remaining at low temperature inside an electron microscope the solvent will 
not evaporate in the high vacuum. This allows to gain high resolution structural 
information.  
 16.1.4.6  Miscellaneous Techniques 
 Other techniques that can be used to measure distribution coefﬁ cients of a guest molecule 
between the bulk aqueous phase and a micellar or vesicular aggregate include gel ﬁ ltra-
tion, electromotive force measurements, solubility and vapor pressure measurements, 
muon spin rotation experiments and headspace gas chromatography.  81 Theoretical models 
are, of course, also helpful, as, for example, in studies of the enveloping of charged pro-
teins by lipid bilayers. 25 
 16.2  Catalysis by Vesicles. Encapsulation of Reactants 
 Micellar catalysis and inhibition of organic reactions has been studied in great detail.  82 
Much less work has been performed on vesicular catalysis and inhibition. The fact that 
most vesicles are meta - stable aggregates is a reason for this lack of popularity. In order 
to obtain satisfactory reproducibility of the rate constants, adequate methods for vesicle 
formation are required and kinetic measurements have to be performed with special care. 
On the other hand, if the reaction is strongly medium dependent and rate constants can 
be measured accurately, rather subtle changes in substrate binding location can be nicely 
revealed. We note here that vesicular catalysis in water can be performed at lower sur-
factant concentrations than in case of micellar catalysis, which is a signiﬁ cant advantage 
from the view point of green chemistry.

Encapsulation Processes by Bilayer Vesicles 
431
 It will be clear that encapsulation of the reactant(s) is a prerequisite for vesicle - induced 
rate effects. In case of unimolecular organic reactions, the change in rate constant relative 
to the rate constant in bulk aqueous solution, is determined by the change in reaction 
environment going from water to the reactant binding sites in the vesicle. Several studies 
have suggested that the reaction environment in the vesicular phase is often less polar 
than that in micelles.  83   Of course, the kinetic effect is a function of the distribution of the 
reactant over the aqueous and vesicular pseudophases. If the medium effects on the reac-
tion are understood in some detail, the vesicle - induced rate effects provide information 
about the nature of the reactant encapsulation process. 
 For bimolecular organic reactions the situation is more complicated. We have now two 
reactants that bind to the vesicle (sometimes one may stay in the aqueous phase), not 
necessarily at similar sites in the aggregate. Vesicular catalysis/inhibition now depends 
on the same environmental factors as described for unimolecular reactions, but also on 
the binding efﬁ ciency, determining the reactant concentrations in the vesicular reaction 
volume. If reactant binding is sufﬁ ciently strong, the local reactant concentrations in the 
vesicular reaction volume may become greater than those in water, with the concominant 
higher rate resulting from this  ‘ concentration effect ’ . Even in the case of a vesicular rate 
constant smaller than the one in water, catalysis may nevertheless be observed due to the 
overruling effect of the higher reactant concentrations. 
 Encapsulation of the reactants in the vesicle can affect rate constants in a number of 
ways. These include the following: (a) a reduced medium polarity in the Stern region and 
particularly deeper in the bilayer; (b) a lower water concentration; (c) for charged vesicles: 
a local electric charge at the surface of the vesicle due to an incomplete counterion binding 
and a signiﬁ cant ionic strength in the Stern region; (d) rates may respond to the bilayer 
ﬂ uidity which is different below and above the main phase transiton temperature, and 
ﬁ nally, the vesicle size  84   may also play a role. We also note that giant vesicles provide 
interesting microchemical vessels for various types of reactions, including decontamina-
tion of mustard - like compounds and polymerization processes. 82 
 16.2.1  Unimolecular Decarboxylation of 6 - NBIC 
 The strongly solvent - dependent, unimolecular decarboxylation of sodium 6 - 
nitrobenzisoxazole - 3 - carboxylate (6 - NBIC, Figure  16.4 ) has been a popular kinetic 
probe for aqueous media containing surfactant aggregates. 
 After pioneering work by Kemp and Paul,  85   the main noncovalent interactions which 
govern the medium effects have been elucidated in some detail by Hilvert  et al . 86

Molecular Encapsulation
Hydrogen - bonding stabilization of the carboxylate group as well as ion - pair formation 
(particularly in apolar, aprotic solvents) retard the reaction by reactant stabilization. 
Breaking - up these interactions and stabilization of the highly polarizable activated 
complex (AC) by London dispersion interactions dramatically accelerate the decarboxyla-
tion. As anticipated, 6 - NBIC binds to positively charged surfaces of surfactant aggregates 
with the aromatic part of the molecule engaging in hydrophobic interactions with meth-
ylene groups of the alkyl tails residing near or at the aggregate ’ s surface. 87,88 
 Reaction rates in the presence of cationic surfactant aggregates can be successfully 
analyzed using the pseudophase model, providing the rate constants for reaction within 
the aggregate (for vesicles,  k ves , taking into account ion exchange processes  89 ). Generally, 
reaction rates increase with decreasing water penetration into the aggregate and with 
decreasing ﬂ uid - like character of the surface of the aggregate:
