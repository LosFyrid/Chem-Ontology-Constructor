self - reproduction (compare Figure  17.7 a). Oleic anhydride is stratiﬁ ed over a alkaline 
solution containing pre - formed oleate vesicles. Due to basic pH values, the anhydride is 
hydrolyzed giving two oleate molecules. In the absence of pre - formed oleate vesicles, 
this reaction would occur at the (macroscopic) anhydride/buffer interface, proceeding in 
a sluggish way. By contrast, when oleate vesicles are present, the anhydride is rapidly 
hydrolyzed thanks to vesicle catalysis. In particular, anhydride is ﬁ rst solubilised in the 
membrane of oleate vesicles, and then hydrolyzed at the membrane/buffer interface. The 
product of such hydrolysis (oleate molecules) are actually the membrane forming mole-
cules, so that an autopoietic process takes place. Following the surface growth, the vesicle 
become unstable, and in turn it may divide in two or more  daughter  vesicles. These vesi-
cles can start again the cycle and convert more anhydride into new oleate vesicles; notice 
that the process is overall  autocatalytic  and that oleate vesicles follow a sigmoid growth

 Recently, by using oleate micelles instead of oleic anhydride, it has been possible to 
apply optical methods to investigate the mechanism of vesicle self - reproduction, leading 
to the discovery of the  ‘ matrix effect ’ , namely the self - reproduction of oleate vesicles in 
a way that the average vesicles size is more or less conserved among vesicle genera-
tions. 24,25,57,86,87   The self - reproduction of vesicles, as shown in Figure  17.8 a, closely resem-
ble the general autopoietic mechanism (Figure  17.7 a), however, the vesicle itself act as 
a sort of catalyst, favoring the transformation of the precursor X (the oleic anhydride) 
into the component of autopoietic unit A (the membrane - forming oleate molecule). In 
more elaborated models, this transformation should be achieved thank to an internal cata-
lysts (compare Figure  17.7 b), which should in turn be reproduced in a true and complete 
autopoietic system. 
 Such complex design has not been realized yet, however there have been two relevant 
attempts ﬁ nalized at this goal. The ﬁ rst, not discussed here, was based on the lipid vesicle 
entrapment of four enzymes, namely the enzymes required to produce phosphatidylcho-
line starting from water - soluble compounds.  88   The aim was to create a lipid - producing 
liposome. The conversion of water - soluble precursors into phosphatidylcholine was 
around 10%, but no morphological changes were observed. A more recent report, based 
on the above mentioned work, is based on protein expression inside liposomes (Figure 
 17.8 b). In this study, the two genes  plsB  and  plsC , codifyng, respectively, for the enzymes 
glycerol - 3 - phosphate acyltransferase (G3PAT, an integral membrane protein), and lyso-
phosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT, a periferal membrane protein), are entrapped 
in a lipid vesicles together with a transcription - translation machinery.  89 The latter  – known 
as PURESYSTEM  90  –  is assembled from puriﬁ ed components, and consists in a set of 
36 enzymes, ribosomes, tRNAs, and all the low molecular - weight components (amino 
acids, GTP, etc.). The composition of lipid membrane (see Table 17.1 entry 23) is opti-
mized in terms of entrapment efﬁ ciency, protein expression yield and  –  more importantly 
 – activity of the two  in situ  synthesized membrane enzymes. This work demonstrates that 
two membrane enzymes can be synthesized in active form inside liposomes. In fact, by 
supplying the substrates  sn - glycerol - 3 - phosphate and palmitoyl - CoA, the ﬁ rst enzyme 
(G3PAT) could produce 1 - palmitoyl - sn - glycerol - 3 - phosphate (a lysophosphatidic acid) 
in 15% yield (% reacted/entrapped). The low yield is due to the low activity of the freshly 
synthesized G3PAT, which is highly hydrophobic, and localizes and folds (in this syn-
thetic system) without assistance of dedicated macromolecules. The second enzyme 
(LPAAT) leads to the ﬁ nal product by adding an oleyl group to the free 2 - hydroxy group 
of lysophosphatidic acid, to give 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycerol - 3 - phosphate, i.e. a 
phospholipid that insert in the liposome membrane. Although the yield of the reaction 
catalyzed by LPAAT is rather high ( ∼ 90%, reacted/entrapped), the overal conversion 
(13.5%) is not very high, also because the two enzymes have different optimal redox 
conditions. 
 If we compare the experimental setup (Figure  17.8 b) with the autopoietic model (Figure 
 17.7 b), it is easy to recognize how the different autopoietic functions are implemented 
experimentally. The key transformation (X    →   L) consists in the  stepwise  reaction between 
 sn - glycerol - 3 - phosphate and palmitoyl - CoA, ﬁ rstly, and oleoyl - CoA, later. The product 
readily inserts in the membrane, as required in Figure  17.7 b. The catalysts C required to 
these transformations are two membrane enzymes (G3PAT and LPAAT), which are 
produced by a metabolic systems, starting from the corresponding DNA genes. What is

missing, in the experimental setup, it is the reproduction of the catalysts, of the machinery, 
and of the genes that are involved in the generation of C (namely, the self - reproduction 
of the PURESYSTEM itself and the replication of genes). This has not been achieved 
yet, in any systems (see below for additional discussion on the consequences of this fact). 
Of course, the low yield of lipid production does not favour the observation of autopoietic 
behaviour, ideally the self - reproduction as in the case of anhydride hydrolysis. Moreover, 
with respect with the open system character of autopoietic cells, the substrates X are 
delivered from outside  –  as required by the model, whereas the building blocks Y (amino 
acids, NTPs, etc.) are co - entrapped with the PURESYSTEM. 
 Type II system .  RNA replication inside self - reproducing vesicles . The biosynthesis of 
RNA molecules inside vesicles is also a very important target. It is commonly accepted, 
in fact, that RNA may play a key role in the early phase of life scenario, as epitomized 
in the RNA world hypothesis  91 – 94   an hypothesis that was considerably strengthened by 
the discovery of ribozymes.  95,96   Two early studies (1994) were focused on this topic. 
Poly(adenilic acid) was synthesized inside lipid vesicles by Joyce and Deamer, by exploit-
ing the polynucleotide phosphorilase (PNPase) catalyzed - polymerization of ADP.  97 
Independently, Walde  et al . reported on the same system, but compartmentalized in self -
 reproducing oleate vesicles.  98   In 1995, Oberholzer  et al . 82   reported the replication of RNA 
strands as catalyzed by Q  β  replicase, with the simultaneous oleate vesicle reproduction 
(Figure  17.9 ). This system will be discussed in detail since it represent an interesting case 
of core - and - shell reproduction, although partially successful. 
 Pre - formed oleate vesicles are ﬁ lled with a template RNA, Q  β  replicase and nucleotides 
triphosphate (NTPs). Then, they are put in contact with a second oil phase consisting in 
oleic anhydride. Two reactions occurs simultaneously. Located at the membrane, the 
solubilization of oleic anhydride and its alkaline hydrolysis takes place, leading to vesicle 
growth and division, as discussed in the previous section. In the aqueous vesicle core, 
on the other hand, Q  β  replicase, being a RNA - dependent RNA polymerase, makes addi-
tional copies of the RNA template at the expenses of NTPs, which are also present in 
the vesicle. Therefore, the number of RNA molecules increase due to the replication 
reaction. Following one or more vesicle division cycles, the content of the vesicle is 
redistributed among the  daughter  vesicles, presumably randomly. This is an example of 
simultaneous (although not  coupled ) core - and - shell reproduction. The core reproduction 
is not complete, however, since the catalyst (Q β  replicase) does not reproduce itself, the 
number of such molecules remaining constant. It is therefore foreseeable that at a certain 
point some vesicles  ‘ die ’  due to the dilution of the catalyst, i.e., no catalytic molecule is 
present in the aqueous core so that the vesicle can undergo to shell reproduction only, 
without replicating its inner RNA. When compared with theoretical model (Figure  17.7 b), 
the system depicted in Figure  17.9  shows that shell self - reproduction occurs at the mem-
brane interface, and it is not catalyzed by an internal autopoietic element. On the other 
hand, internalized components are replicated (RNA molecules), but the catalyst is not 
(Q  β  replicase). Moreover, the precursor X (oleic anhydride) is delivered from the envi-
ronment, whereas the building blocks Y (NTPs in this case), are co - entrapped with the 
template and the enzyme inside the vesicles, from the beginning (the system is therefore 
semi - open, as in the previous case). Very recently, Yomo and co - workers  99 reported on 
the Q  β  replicase - catalyzed replication of RNA coding for Q  β  replicase itself  – inside 
liposomes. In this autocatalytic system, RNA is replicated by Q  β  replicase, and Q  β

 Figure 17.9   RNA replication inside self - reproducing oleate vesicles. Q β replicase, an 
RNA - dependent RNA polymerase is entrapped inside oleate vesicles, in the presence of 
RNA template and NTPs. Copies of the RNA template are produced, and, simultaneously, 
oleate vesicles grow and divide according to the mechanism shown in Figure  17.6 . In this 
way, internal RNA is replicated within self - reproducing vesicles. The mechanism stops 
when a daughter vesicles, produced by division of a previously grown vesicle, does not 
contain any Q β replicase molecule. This vesicle  ‘ dies ’ due to the dilution of the catalyst.  82 
Notice that if solutes are always retained in every division step (i.e., without any loss in 
the environment) when only one Q β replicase is present in a certain grown vesicle, the 
division will produce one functional daughter vesicle  
replicase is produced from RNA. The number of two components increases, giving rise 
to a dual numerical and functional replication. Also in this case, however, the system 
does not fully reproduce itself since lipids do not reproduced and  –  more importantly 
 –  the catalysts for the transformation RNA    →  Q  β  replicase (i.e. ribosomes, tRNAs, etc.) 
do not as well. 
 In Table  17.1 , there are additional examples of RNA synthesis inside vesicles, generally 
done by means of a DNA - dependent RNA polymerase. 
 Type III system .  DNA synthesis inside fatty acid vesicles . DNA is today the cellular 
macromolecule where the information about the proteins sequence is stored as ordered 
nucleobases sequence. DNA is thought to appear later than RNA in the molecular evolu-
tion, mainly with the function of storage. Its minor reactivity (due to loss of 2 ′ - OH group) 
favour its chemical stability. The use of DNA polymerization in vesicle - based cell models 
aims to demonstrate how nucleic acids can be synthesized inside compartments, again 
in an origin - of - life perspective. However, due to the recent developments of DNA - based 
biotechnologies, it is possible that DNA - reactions in micro -  or submicro - compartments

may achieve a technological relevance. Our ﬁ rst report (1995) on DNA synthesis in 
liposomes  100   by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated how all common 
processes involved in this very important process are compatible with phospholipid 
vescles (DNA melting, primer annealing, and DNA extension). More recently, Szostak 
and co - workers showed that polymerase - free DNA extension takes place inside fatty acid 
vesicles. 101   In this system, the composition of vesicle membrane was optimized in order 
to display resistance to Mg 2+  ions (needed for DNA oligomerization), as well as maximal 
permeability to reactants, which were added externally. Three different vesicles were 
studied: ( i ) myristoleate  :  glycerol monomyristoleate (2  :  1) vesicles; ( ii ) decanoate:1 -
 decanol  :  glycerol monodecanoate (4  :  1  :  1); and ( iii ) myristoleate  :  farnesol (2  :  1). In all 
cases, the properties of mixed membranes were superior to those of membrane composed 
by pure components. A DNA template was entrapped inside vesicles, together with a 
primer, and the nucleotides (in form of activated nucleotides, i.e., 2 ′ - amino - 2 ′ ,3 ′ -
 dideoxyguanosine - 5 ′  - phosphorimidazolide) were added externally. It has been demon-
strated that activated nucleotides could permeate the vesicle membrane and react inside 
vesicles, giving rise to DNA extension in the absence of catalyst. The product, which 
has high molecular weight (a DNA oligomer 15   bp long) does not escape from the vesi-
cles. When compared with the general autopoietic scheme (Figure  17.7 b), the current 
work shows how building blocks can enter the compartment and fuel the internal oli-
gomerization reaction, driven by thermodynamics thanks to the activation of nucleotides. 
Boundary molecules are not reproduced, however, and no reaction  ‘ rules ’  are provided 
by the internal organization. 
 Type IV system .  Protein synthesis inside lipid vesicles . The ﬁ eld of protein expression 
inside compartments is certainly the most advanced one in context of compartmentalized 
reactions. To date, in fact, it represents the state of the art in the construction of synthetic 
cells (more properly, semi - synthetic cells). This interest is due to the above mentioned 
convergence of some aspects of synthetic biology and experimental studies on the origins 
of life. A comprehensive review of studies on semi - synthetic cells has been recently 
published by us,  7   and other reviews have discussed this subject;  55,102   here we will comment 
on a couple of relevant examples and highlighting some trends and future perspectives. 
The complete list of published works can be found in Table  17.1 . 
 In their 2004 paper, Noireaux and Libchaber describe a very intriguing vesicle - based 
system based on the entrapment of cell extracts within giant vesicles.  49 This work is of 
particular interest because it introduces a conceptual advancement when compared with 
the previous studies. In particular, a plasmid encoding for two proteins is ﬁ rst entrapped 
in giant vesicles, and the two genes are expressed by the transcription/translation machin-
ery, which was also entrapped together with the plasmid (Figure  17.10 a). The two proteins 
were, respectively, the green ﬂ uorescent protein (GFP), which acts as reporter, and  α -
 hemolysin, a water soluble protein that can self - assemble at the membrane into heptamers, 
which constitute a pore (cut - off  ∼ 3   kDa). Hemolysin has the function to create a pore, 
allowing the nutrients (such as additional amino acids, NTPs, and other low molecular 
weight compounds, present in the environment) entering in the liposome, so that addi-
tional GFP (and hemolysin as well) are produced. In this way, it was shown that protein 
synthesis could be extended up to four days (whereas in  ‘ closed ’  vesicles, it generally 
stops after few hours). Even if not stated in the original paper, the formation of the pore 
also allows the escape from vesicle interior of reaction byproducts. This paper is important

because it is the ﬁ rst example of a synthetic cell that interacts with its environment due 
to the presence of an internally synthesized compound. It is easy to imagine that such 
process may be also triggered by an external chemical signal, that may enter in the vesicle 
and stimulate the production of the pore - forming compound, starting in this way a sort 
of communication between the synthetic cell and the environment.  103 Alternatively, an 
internalized byproduct may activate a similar process. If we compare this work with the 
general mechanism (Figure  17.7 b), it is remarkable that the Noireaux and Libchaber 
work 49 fulﬁ ls the conditions of cell/environment communication, and has a complex 
metabolism inside. It does not reproduce the membrane, however, and the internalized 
components are also not reproduced. 
 The second example deals with our contribution to the development of semi - synthetic 
minimal cells, that in the recent years has been very technical, but with important con-
ceptual and physical spin - off, as we will shortly illustrate here. Cell - free protein expres-
sion is a well established procedure, born more than forty years ago  104 and the ﬁ rst studies

vesicles has been recently postulated.  30

on protein expression inside liposomes made use of home - made or commercially avail-
able cellular extracts. Very recently, however, Ueda and co - workers developed a new 
protein expression kit consisting of puriﬁ ed components. 90,105   Such kit, now commercially 
available with the trademark PURESYSTEM ®  (Post Genome Institute Co., Ltd., Tokyo), 
i.e. PUriﬁ ed Recombinant Enzymes SYSTEM. As already shortly discussed before, 
PURESYSTEM is composed by 36 individually puriﬁ ed (and His 6 - tagged) enzymes, 
tRNAs mixture, and puriﬁ ed ribosomes. It has been shown that the PURESYSTEM is 
the smallest set of macromolecules required to synthesize proteins  in vitro . It follows, 
then, that the genes codifying for the 36 PURESYSTEM proteins, plus the genes codify-
ing for the 55 macromolecular components of the ribosomes, and those codifying for a 
minimal tRNA set (for a total of about 150 genes), represent a good starting point to 
deﬁ ne operationally the  minimal genome . In a recent study, the group of Moya, based 
on comparative genomics, indicated that the minimal genome should correspond to a 
deﬁ nite set of around 200 genes.  106   It is therefore important to develop minimal cells 
models by using the PURESYSTEM because: (1) from a theoretical point of view, the 
components of PURESYSTEMS and the corresponding genes are  the  parts of a minimal 
semi - synthetic cell, representing, respectively, the minimal number of catalytic macro-
molecules and the minimal genome (notice that a small number of additional functions 
are possibly required); (2) from the  ‘ constructive ’  point of view, it is very valuable car-
rying out experiments with a reconstructed mixture of macromolecules, with known 
concentrations, instead of using  ‘ black boxes ’  as cellular extracts (notice that one of the 
features of synthetic biology is the  ‘ standardization ’  of molecular parts, see for example 
 http://parts.mit.edu ). We therefore started to systematically use PURESYSTEM in com-
partmentalized protein synthesis studies;  107   other research groups are also shifting to this 
molecular tool.  58   The use of PURESYSTEM has another advantage. Since the concentra-
tion of components are known, it is possible to evaluate some physico - chemical param-
eters that were not available in cell extracts. For example, in a recent study, we have 
established a method for protein synthesis inside small (100   nm radius) vesicles,  30 consist-
ing in forming small vesicles in one step, by the already mentioned ethanol injection 
method. By this method, liposomes form spontaneously by lipid self - assembly, and in 
the process of their formation, solutes are entrapped inside liposomes. After entrapment, 
it has been possible to detect the synthesis of green ﬂ uorescent protein within this very 
tiny compartments, albeit in low yield. When this yield was compared with the theoretical 
expected value, it resulted greatly  enhanced , since the calculated yield is about zero. In 
fact, thanks to the knowledge of concentration of PURESYSTEM components, it is pos-
sible to show that the Poisson probability of ﬁ nding a 100   nm (radius) vesicle containing 
all required macromolecular components (and therefore capable to host protein synthesis) 
is about 10  − 26 . But, since protein synthesis did occur in small vesicles, it has been sug-
gested that the entrapment inside lipid vesicles may diverge signiﬁ cantly from the 
expected behaviour, so that inner solute concentration may overcome the external one 
by a factor  > 10 (see Figure  17.10 b). To these super - concentrated vesicles, which may 
represent a very small fraction of the whole population, can be ascribed the observed 
protein synthesis. When compared with EGFP synthesis in bulk water, it also follows 
that the internalized components display an activity which is at least one order of mag-
nitude higher. This result paves the way to new and more detailed investigation on the

physics of vesicle entrapment, so that a new theoretical understanding of this basic phe-
nomenon may appear in the future. 
 Compartmentalized protein synthesis, as noticed above, combines cell - free expression 
with liposome technology. Several important systems have been designed and experi-
mentally done, as shown by the several reports collected in Table  17.1 . There are, 
however, goals not yet achieved, such as the simultaneous protein synthesis (inside the 
vesicle) and vesicle self - reproduction, as done in the case of Q  β replicase experiment. 82 
Moreover, these two processes should occur not only simultaneously, but must be func-
tionally  coupled , i.e. the ﬁ rst process should affect the second, as tentatively done in 
the case of lipid - synthesizing liposomes.  88,89   However, this would not sufﬁ ce. In order 
to make an autopoietic minimal cell, the self - reproduction (or self - replication) of all 
internalized metabolic components is required, so that the issue of  ‘ death by dilution ’ 
is avoided. 
 17.6  Conclusion 
 The importance of compartmentalized reactions is constantly growing and evolving. After 
about 20 years from the ﬁ rst reports on enzymes inside liposomes, current research deals 
also with the assembly of semi - synthetic cells. 
 In this chapter, we have ﬁ rstly discussed the general issue of reactions in liposomes 
from a technical viewpoint. Starting from this basic knowledge, that is general and can 
be applied to whatever chemical system, we have then discussed some relevant examples 
of complex biochemical reactions in liposomes and fatty acid vesicles. This choice reﬂ ects 
the authors ’  interest, more than representing the large spectrum of possible applications,  108 
or the more general ﬁ eld of water - soluble enzymes entrapped inside liposomes (recently 
reviewed by Walde and Ichikawa  31  ). The use of liposomes as a tool to study membrane -
 proteins has also been skipped. 109 
 Despite the advanced of recent years, several open questions are still under debate, and 
future work will maybe clarify some of the important aspects we have discussed in this 
chapter. There are also need of technical advancements, for example to improve the 
reproducibility of vesicle preparation for carrying out compartmentalized reactions. 
 In conclusion, reactions inside vesicles are a challenging and attractive ﬁ eld of inquiry, 
requiring often a multidisciplinary approach, technical skills, efforts and curiosity. The 
most advanced studies on construction of semi - synthetic minimal cells, for example, that 
have also important philosophical aspects, witnessed recently an abrupt rise of interest. 
It appears that one additional reason for this may lie in a sense of conﬁ dence that the 
minimal cell is indeed an experimentally accessible target.
