Intermediates

 10.1  Introduction 
 The inclusion of molecules is a very common technique in the pharmaceutical sciences 
to protect sensitive compounds and increase their usability and their storage time. For 
example, drugs were enclosed in host molecules like cyclodextrins. This topic has been 
previously reviewed. 1 
 The same approach can be applied to organic chemistry where very labile species can 
be encapsulated. In this way, species that usually would rapidly decompose or polymerize 
even at low temperatures can be stored at room temperature, especially when the guest 
has no chance to escape from its host. To achieve this goal, hemicarcerands have been 
mostly used, leading to the preparation of cages containing highly reactive species such 
as 1,3 - cyclobutadiene, cycloheptatetraene, or benzyne. This subject is presented in detail 
in a specially dedicated chapter (Reactions inside Carcerands, Ralf Warmuth). 
 Similarly, very useful results can be obtained if the labile species is not incarcerated 
but can easily be released from its cage. Obviously, this property is signiﬁ cant in order 
to have a chance to use the guest or its products. In this section, we will ﬁ rst present what 
can be done to increase the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of a labile species with 
the aim to increase its relative concentration during the reaction or to make it more per-
sistent. Second, we will show a few examples to demonstrate how to stabilize some

speciﬁ c noncovalent assemblies and to enforce a change in the conformation of the guest. 
Finally, the focus will be put on highly reactive intermediates (radicals, radical cations, 
carbenes, and nitrenes) showing how to protect them from the surroundings in order to 
prevent their trapping but also to modify their reactivity to be able to obtain products that 
would not be found otherwise. Taking examples from the supramolecular chemistry of 
carbenes and nitrenes, more details will be given about the methodology used in these 
studies. 
 10.2  Encapsulation of Labile Species 
 The following results show some recent improvements toward the possibility to carry out 
water sensitive reactions in aqueous solution using hydrophobic catalysts. 
 The ﬁ rst example concerns the attempt to isolate a common reactive intermediate. An 
ordinary easily occurring reaction is the addition of primary amines to carbonyl groups 
to form imines. The main intermediate of this condensation reaction is a hemiaminal 
which can be observed only in special cases because the release of water proceeds very 
rapidly. A cavitand could be built which is able to increase the concentration of hemi-
aminal during the reaction and allows its observation by NMR spectroscopy (Scheme 
 10.1 ). 2 Cavitand  1a  is based on a resorcinarene - based bowl, a macrocycle easily available

by condensation of resorcinol with aldehydes under acidic conditions. Usually, long chain 
aldehydes are used to improve the solubility of the container. The hydroxy groups on the 
upper rim offer the possibility to deepen the cavity and to introduce a large variety of 
functionalities. In the case of  la , the upper rim has been functionalized with an anthracene 
arm bearing an aldehyde group and with amido groups to obtain a rigid vase conformation 
ﬁ rmly maintained by intramolecular hydrogen bonds. In mesitylene, a solvent too large 
to be accommodated in the cavity and therefore not competiting for inclusion, various 
small amines  2  can be complexed. Formation of the hemiaminal  3  is relatively fast but 
the elimination of water to afford imine  4  is slowed. In solution, dehydration is induced 
by a second amine molecule. Due to the conﬁ nement in a limited space, this step is ham-
pered. Thus, the hemiaminal accumulates and its concentration declines only slowly over 
time with a half life of 30 to 90  min. 
 This strategy has been expanded to the observation of isoimide intermediates  5 . 
Isoimides are obtained by a formal insertion of isonitriles into the OH bond of carboxylic 
acids. Usually, high temperatures are required and the addition product is rapidly stabi-
lized by a 1,3 -  O → N  acyl transfer to form  N - acylformamide  6 . 3   Under these conditions, 
no signiﬁ cant amounts of isoimide  5  are present in the solution during the reaction. 
However, the previously described cavitand  1a , after oxidation to carboxylic acid  1b , can 
be used to reveal the intermediacy of the isoimide (Scheme  10.2 ).  4 Addition of isopropyl 
isonitrile to a solution of cavitand  1b in mesitylene - d 12  induces the folding of the host to 
its vase conformation and inclusion of the guest in direct proximity to the acidic group. 
In this conﬁ ned space, addition occurs at room temperature and the isoimide intermediate 
 5  can be observed by NMR and IR spectroscopy at millimolar concentrations before 
completion of the rearrangement to acylformamide  6 . 
 One of the most remarkable contributions is the generation of iminium ions in water 
in good yields combined with the ability to conserve these ions for months in this solu-
tion. Iminium ions are easily formed by the condensation of secondary amines with 
carbonyl groups in an equilibrium reaction. However, they are very sensitive to hydro-
lyses and are not viable in water except if they are suitably encapsulated. The water 
soluble self - assembled  Ga L
4
6
12− complex  5   is a suitable container for this purpose (Scheme 
 10.3 ). 6   The four gallium ions are bridged by six bis - bidentate catecholamide ligands L 
forming a 12 - fold negatively charged tetrahedron. This assembly is a perfect host for 
organic cations. Indeed, stirring a mixture of ketone, pyrrolidine ( 7 ), and   Ga L
4
6
12− leads 
to the inclusion of the corresponding iminium ions  8 . Obviously, the generation of a suit-
able guest and its inclusion constitute a sufﬁ cient driving force to shift the equilibrium

toward the iminium product. The best yields are obtained with pentanones and hexanones 
(80 – 90%) due to an optimal ﬁ t of the size of the guest in the hydrophobic cavity. 
 An analogous approach is the stabilization of phosphonium ions by addition of phos-
phanes (PMe 3 , PEt 3 , PPhMe 2 , and PPh 2 Me) to methyl ketones (acetone, methyl ethyl 
ketone, 1,1,1 - triﬂ uoroacetone, and ﬂ uoroacetone) in an aqueous solution of   Ga L

(Scheme  10.4 ). 7   These cations decompose in water but they are persistent for weeks in 
the nanovessel. However, this stability is pH - dependant. The pH should be low because 
the guest should be protonated and is regularly exposed to the bulk of water as a conse-
quence of the dynamic behavior of the assembly, but the pH should not be too low because 
in that case the host would disassemble. Therefore, the optimal value is 5.2. The exact 
mechanism is still unknown; it has been ascertained that the protonated phosphane can 
be encapsulated but it is not possible to determine where the addition to the ketone occurs, 
inside or outside the cavity. Due to the chirality of the   Ga L
4
6
12− tetrahedron, a kinetic 
diastereoselectivity is also obtained with chiral ions leading to diastereomeric excesses 
of 30 – 50%. 
 The effect of encapsulation can be quite impressive. White phosphorus (P 4 tetrahe-
drons), a strongly pyrophoric compound, spontaneously burns when exposed to air releas-
ing considerable amounts of energy deriving from the release of strain and the replacement 
of the weak P − P bonds by strong P − O bonds. Under inclusion in the self - assembled 
tetrahedral cage   Fe L

water in the presence of oxygen (Scheme  10.5 ).  8   The cage is formed by stirring 2 - formylpy-
ridine ( 9 ) with 4,4 ′ - diaminobiphenyl - 2,2 ′ - disulfonic acid ( 10 ) in the presence of iron(II)

has a purple color and is diamagnetic because iron(II) is in its low spin state. With a 
cavity volume of 140    Å 3 , it encloses preferably small cyclic hydrocarbons but no organic 
cations, probably because of its small total charge. The cage dissociates back to its build-
ing block in a reversible manner at low pH as a consequence of protonation of the ligands. 
It can also be irreversibly decomposed by addition of a chelating amine resulting in an 
imine exchange reaction.  10   The preparation of the complex is achieved by mixing an

−. The decrease in reactivity is not 
mainly due to exclusion of dioxygen from P 4  as the dynamic nature of the host and the 
small size of dioxygen do not allow obtaining a strict separation of the reactant. The main 
reason is that the reaction products and intermediates are too large to ﬁ t into the cavity. 
However, this dynamic inclusion has one important advantage: the reactive guest can 
easily be released by extraction with benzene or cyclohexane where P 4  can exhibit its 
reactivity and be oxidized to ﬁ nally give phosphoric acid H 3 PO 4 . In this case, the removal 
of P 4  is performed by using a competing guest for the cavity; with  n - heptane, the extrac-
tion is not successful. 
 A further example concerns the isolation of cyclic trimers of siloxanes.  11 These cyclic 
trimers are usually short - lived kinetic products generated during the ﬁ rst phase of the 
polycondensation of trisilanols.  12   In a bulk, they usually further condense to higher oli-
gomers which are thermodynamically more stable and therefore, these trimers cannot be 
isolated. However, when the condensation of phenyltrimethoxysilane PhSi(OMe) 3 is 
performed in the   M L
6
4
12+ nanocage  12 , only the cyclic trimer  14  is obtained under stereo-
chemistry control giving exclusively the all - cis isomer (Scheme  10.6 ). 
 Nanocage  12  is a stable complex which can easily be prepared in boiling water by 
self - assembly of 6 units of a platinum nitrate salt with 4 molecules of a tris(4 - pyridyl)
triazine  11  panel as ligand. The holes between the panels are sufﬁ ciently large to allow 
solvents and small molecules like PhSi(OMe) 3  to enter or exit the cage. At 100    ° C in an 
aqueous solution of capsule  12 , PhSi(OMe) 3  is hydrolyzed within ﬁ ve minutes to trisilanol 
 13 . The large cavity of  12  encloses three or four molecules of  13  at once forming the 
complex ( 13 ) 3 – 4 @ 12  which can be monitored by NMR. The condensation takes place in 
the cavity until trimer  14  is formed. However,  14  is too bulky to escape or to condense 
further. The reaction is then stopped at this level and  14  imprisoned in cage  12  can be 
isolated in 92% yield by ﬁ ltration and recrystallization. The complex  14 @ 12  is now stable 
in an aqueous solution and even under acidic conditions (pH  <  1). 
 Using this methodology, the size and shape of the cavity determines which oligomer 
will be isolated (Scheme  10.7 ). Indeed, bowl  16  produces dimer  19  whereas the small 
coordination tube  21 , which allows the complexation of only one molecule of the reactant, 
affords monomer  18 , a silanetriol.  13   In this case, starting from 4 equiv of 3,5 - bis(3 - pyridyl)
pyridine  20  and 6 equiv of Pd(en)(NO 3 ) 2 , tube  21  can only be prepared  in situ  by means

of the template effect of 2 - naphthyltrimethoxylsilane  17  forming complex  17 @ 21 . 
Aromatic compound  17  is a very suitable guest due to strong   π – π  and CH – π interaction 
between its naphthyl group and the pyridyl panels. At this temperature,  17  slowly hydro-
lyzes to  18  as revealed by monitoring of the reaction by NMR. Prolonged heating gives 
 18 @ 21 , a complex in which only the hydrophobic naphthyl group is deeply included in 
the tube. The hydrophilic Si(OH) 3  group is still exposed outside the cavity but the steri-
cally demanding tube framework prevents further polycondensation. Moreover, these 
experiments demonstrate that full enclosure of the reactive center in a cage is not always 
necessary to stabilize an intermediate and partial inclusion can be sufﬁ cient.  18 @ 21 was 
isolated in very good yield (92%), recrystallized from water, and submitted to X - ray 
analysis. 
 10.3  Isolation of Non - covalently Bonded Aggregates

ordered adamantanoid (H 2 O) 10  cluster has been obtained; this structure corresponds to the 
basic unit of I 6 - type ice (Figure  10.1 ). 14   The structure could be revealed by an X - ray dif-
fraction study at  − 180  ° C. The position of the hydrogen atoms was determined by single -
 crystal neutron diffraction at room temperature with crystals prepared from D 2 O. In this 
case, the recognition of the molecular ice by the cage is quite peculiar because it does 
not occur through OH – π  hydrogen bonding but through interaction of the lone pair of the 
4 bridgehead water molecules with the aromatic   π  - system of the 4 triazine walls of the 
cationic  Pd L

12+ cage  22b . This highly ordered structure of the water cluster is quite stable: 
it is still not molten at room temperature. 
 Similarly, encapsulation favors the formation of stable hydrogen - bonded dimers. In 
aqueous solution, the hydrophobic cavity protects the hydrogen bonds between the pair 
from the concurrence of the water molecules. For example, four base pairs are required 
for the stable association of two DNA strands in water. In a cage, only one pair of nucle-
otide is necessary to achieve a selective binding as demonstrated by the formation of a 
hydrogen - bonded aggregate between 5 ′ - adenosine monophosphate  24 and 5 ′ - uridine 
monophosphate  25  resulting in the preferred formation of complex  24.25 @ 23 over 
( 24 ) 2 @ 23  and ( 25 ) 2 @ 23 (Scheme  10.8 ). 15   This selectivity is due to the fact that the 
nucleobases cannot efﬁ ciently form hydrogen bridges with themselves. The pillared cage 
 23  is an appropriate host because it possesses a ﬂ at hydrophobic pocket perfectly suited 
for the binding of planar aromatic guests as a result of an ideal interplanary distance 
between the panels (6.6    Å ).  23  is obtained by self - assembly of two tris(4 - pyridyl)triazine 
and three 1,4 - pyrazine ligands with six Pt(en)(NO 3 ) 2  edges in the presence of coronene 
as an aromatic template. 
 Structures held together by metal - metal  d – d  interaction can also be prepared using 
encapsulation. Inﬁ nite stacking of metal complexes is quite common in the solid or in the 
liquid crystalline state and these structures possess interesting electroconductive and

mize the interactions with the twisted dimer of Pt(acac) 2 . Evidence for the  d – d interaction

(acen) ( S  =  0) a green 1  :  1 complex is obtained (Scheme  10.10 ). 19 SQUID measurements 
show that the ground state is then coupled with the high - spin state ( S  =  1) via a spin - orbit 
interaction. The spin crossover results from interactions between the   dz2 orbital of Ni(II) 
with the triazine ring of the panel forming a pseudo octahedral ligand ﬁ eld. 
 10.4  Inclusion of Reactive Intermediates 
 10.4.1  Viologen Radical Cations 
 Viologens (4,4 ′  - bipyridinium) are widely used because of their electron - transfer proper-
ties. However, application is often hindered by the poor stability of the corresponding 
cation radical. Inclusion in a macromolecule should largely prevent intermolecular reac-
tions or dimerization of this reactive species. Cucurbiturils, which easily can be synthe-
sized from glycoluril and formaldehyde, are perfect hosts for organic cations due to their 
rigidity and the combination of a hydrophobic cavity with a very polar rim of urea groups 
leading to high association constants. The main drawback is their poor solubility in water 
and in organic solvents.  20   Thus, the dication methyl viologen ( 28 ) is tightly bound by 
cucurbit[7]uril (k   =  1  ×  10 5  M  − 1  for  28 @CB[7]). 21   This value is signiﬁ cantly higher than 
those determined, for the previously studied complexes with the more ﬂ exible cyclodex-
trins (10 3 – 10 4  M  − 1 ). Upon inclusion,  28  indeed keeps its electrochemical properties and

still undergoes a reversible one - electron reduction to radical cation  28 * without changes 
in the kinetic. The reduced complex  28  * @CB[7] with the radical cation is still ﬁ rmly 
bonded because the guest is still charged. Further reduction leads to a neutral viologen 
which for the most part is released from the host.  22 
 This approach can also be applied for example to the protection of polyaniline (PANI), 
one of the most useful conducting polymer due to its stability and the simple control of 
the conductivity through doping/dedoping strategies with protons or oxidizing agents. 
Polyaniline is obtained by oxidation of aniline, mostly with ammonium persulfate. The 
reduced form is the colorless leucoemeraldine with phenyl rings connected by amine 
bonds (Scheme  10.12 A). In the fully oxidized violet pernigraniline state, the links consist 
of imine groups. The most interesting form is the half - oxidized emeraldine, a blue - green 
paramagnetic polyradical cation which possesses a high conductivity of 1000   S   cm  − 1 . This 
conjugated polymer is therefore very interesting for application in molecular electronics. 
However, interchain interactions, coiling and the chemical stability of the molecule are 
common problems. A widely used approach is the encapsulation of the chain to form an 
insulated molecular wire.  23   In the case of emeraldine, it has been shown that   β - cyclodextrin 
can be threaded into the polymer forming a molecular necklace, a pseudopolyrotaxane. 
In  N - methyl - 2 - pyrrolidone, complexation by   β - cyclodextrin forces the polyaniline chain 
to change its conformation from coil to rod because the close packing of host molecules 
with a narrow cavity strongly favors the linear all -  trans conﬁ guration of the chain, the

conﬁ guration required to realize high conductivity.  24   This process is disfavored by entropy 
and therefore, it is only observed at temperatures below 2  ° C. Moreover, this insulated 
emeraldine is protected from chemical oxidation by iodine. Similarly, polyaniline has 
been threaded into a   β - 1,3 - glucan 25   and also into a more rigid molecular nanotube 
(Scheme  10.12 B) consisting of   α  - CD macrocycles which have been crosslinked with 
epichlorhydrin using polyethylene glycol as a template.  26   This linearized molecular wire 
could be observed by atomic force microscopy. 27 
 The strength of this approach is best illustrated by the stabilization of the radical cation 
 31 * +  of the dimer of polyaniline  29 conﬁ ned as a rotaxane in the cavity of cucurbit[7]
uril, an assembly soluble in a wide range of polar organic solvents (Scheme  10.13 ). 28 
Whereas in water the neutral rotaxane  31 @CB[7] is rapidly oxidized by oxygen to form 
the blue radical cation  31 * + @CB[7] which is relatively persistent toward further oxida-
tion, the free dimer  31  requires ammonium persulfate oxidation yielding the benzoquinoid 
dication  31 2+ almost directly. As shown by square wave voltammetry, these ﬁ ndings can 
be explained by a thermodynamic stabilization of the radical cation  31 * +  in comparison 
to the neutral  31  as a consequence of the strong afﬁ nity of the cucurbiturils for cations 
(The ﬁ rst oxidation potential is lowered by 570  mV upon rotaxanation). The resistance 
against further oxidation is the result of a kinetic effect (The second oxidation potential 
remains practically unchanged). The rotaxane  31 @CB[7] is synthesized in good yields 
by reductive amination of the complexed and protonated aniline  29 @CB[7] with the 
aldehyde stoppers  30 .

 10.4.2  Radicals 
 The supramolecular chemistry of radicals has been widely investigated, especially with 
stable radicals like TEMPO or benzyl  t - butyl nitroxide. 29   This is because radicals 
can be observed by EPR spectroscopy, a method particularly suitable to obtain kinetic 
information about the association and dissociation processes in the time range between 
10  − 9  and 10  − 5  seconds, i.e., for complexes displaying fast exchange on the NMR 
time scale. 
 More reactive radicals have been generated by photochemical cleavage of esters and 
ketones in dendrimers. Under these conditions, the radical pair remains encapsulated in 
a cage and the two moieties can better recombine. Furthermore, their mobility is reduced. 
One of the most impressive results is obtained by the cleavage of 1 - naphthyl phenylacyl 
ester  32 (Scheme  10.14 ). 30   Whereas the photolysis in hexane solution leads to a mixture 
of seven products, the reaction in an aqueous solution of  G2  or  G3  poly(alkyl aryl ether) 
dendrimers of the second (respectively, the third) generation at pH 9 is highly selective. 
This increase in selectivity is mainly caused by the short life - time of the singlet radical 
pair  33  and  34  in the conﬁ ned environment of the dendritic pocket. In hexane, the high 
persistency of the radicals allows the dimethyl phenylacyl radical  34  to split off CO to 
form the stable tertiary radical  35 . The rate of this decarbonylation reaction has been 
determined to be 1.5  ×  10 8  s  − 1 . The high persistency of the radicals is also the reason why 
they have enough time to diffuse away in hexane and ﬁ nally recombine to the symmetrical 
diphenylbutane  41  and naphthol  40 . In the dendrimer, recombination occurs in less than 
6   ns. On this time scale, as a consequence of the high viscosity of the medium and the 
restricted mobility of the radical pair, the recombination remains highly selective and 
formation of the  ortho - ketone  36  is strongly preferred (93% in  G2  and 96% in  G3 ). The 
sole side product is the  para - isomer  37 , the other pathways are still not open. Moreover, 
during this short time period, the radicals do not leak from the hydrophobic dendritic 
cavity to the water bulk. Thus, no products result from hydrolysis. Especially this absence 
of hydrolysis products and the high selectivity of the reaction in the relatively open den-
drimer of the second generation are remarkable. Experiments based on the generation of 
long - lived triplet radical pairs which can only recombine if they undergo intersystem 
crossing have shown that the dendrimer cavities are leak - proof even on the microsecond 
time scale. Performing this photolysis in a SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) micelle leads 
to similar results but the reaction is less selective. Additional examples are described in 
the ﬁ rst chapter of this book. 
 The particular steric conditions prevailing in guest – host systems allow the observation 
of some unusual reactions which are rarely observed in solution (Scheme  10.15 ). This is 
the case for the photooxidation of adamantane  43  in the   Pd L
6
4
12+ cage  22b  which leads to 
the generation of an adamantyl radical in an anion radical ( 43 3 . 43 * @ 22b *  −  ). 31 This reac-
tion is caused by the narrow conﬁ nement of four adamantane molecules in  43 4 @ 22b 
which are pressed against the triazine core of the ligand (host – guest distance  =  2.6  Å ). 
This triazine being coordinated to three pyridines and being part of a cationic cage is a 
particularly efﬁ cient electron acceptor which can remove an electron from the guest. The 
freshly  in situ  generated adamantyl radical cation then loses a proton and selectively forms 
the tertiary 1 - adamantyl radical  43  *  because it is more stable than the 2 - adamantyl radical. 
Finally, reaction with water or oxygen leads to the formation of 1 - adamantanol  44 and

spectroscopy.  
 10.4.3  Carbenes 
 Carbenes are species comprising a divalent carbon atom. Because this carbon has only 
six valence electrons, it is highly electron - deﬁ cient and reactive.  32 However, depending 
on the groups attached to the carbenic carbon, the stability and the philicity of these 
species vary greatly.  33   For example, the  N  - heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) which have been 
recognized as powerful organocatalysts and ligands are nucleophilic and can even be 
isolated. However, they remain air and moisture - sensitive. These compounds illustrate 
why a supramolecular approach is useful in this ﬁ eld. It allows the broadening of the 
reaction conditions in which sensitive intermediates can be applied and manipulated. 
Classical approaches include complexation of the carbene with Lewis - acids like CO 2 or 
the highly electrophilic SiCl 4 . However, these compounds tend to be too stable. Good 
results are also obtained with the use of a polydimethylsiloxane matrix which compen-
sates the weaker acidity of the silicon atoms in silicone by its macromolecularity. The 
stabilization interaction is low (3 – 5  kcal  mol  − 1 ), preserving the reactivity but nevertheless 
allows for storing and handling in the presence of air. 34 
 Most of the work concerning the modiﬁ cation of carbene reactivity has been performed 
on cyclodextrins (CD) with reactive alkyl carbenes. Diazirines have proven to be the most 
convenient precursors due to the small size of the three - membered ring and the volatility 
of the leaving group, molecular nitrogen. Diazirines are usually obtained from the 
corresponding ketone in two steps: in a methanolic solution of ammonia, hydroxylamine -
 O  - sulfonic acid (HOSA) is added yielding a diaziridine which then is oxidized to the 
diazirine, most conveniently with iodine. 
 On a laboratory scale, the complexes are prepared by the coprecipitation method:  35 the 
guest is added to an aqueous solution of the hydrophilic cyclodextrin. The complex is 
usually less soluble, precipitates and can be isolated by ﬁ ltration or centrifugation. For 
water - insoluble guests, diethyl ether can be used to facilitate the phase transfer. The ether 
then can be blown away by bubbling argon through the solution. The main driving forces 
for the complex formation are hydrophobic and van - der - Waals interactions. These are the

reasons why the most important criteria for a high association constant are a good ﬁ t 
between the dimensions of the guest and the cavity of cyclodextrins and a high polarizabil-
ity of the guest molecules. In water, the driving force for complex formation is governed 
by the hydrophobicity of the inner surface of the cyclodextrins. Indeed, any water mol-
ecules residing inside the cavity are higher in energy because they cannot build an exten-
sive network of hydrogen bonds. They are then readily displaced by the hydrophobic 
guest in order to minimize the surface where water molecules are in contact with apolar 
units. 
 To understand the reactivity of a carbene entrapped inside a host molecule, the proper-
ties of the inclusion complex should be investigated ﬁ rst. This occurs by measurement of 
the changes in the physical properties of the guest upon complexation. Whereas spectro-
photometric and ﬂ uorescence spectroscopy are most useful for dyes and conductometric 
studies for ionic compounds, diazirines in cyclodextrins are best studied applying circular 
dichroism  36   and NMR spectroscopy. Indeed, circular dichroism which measures the dif-
ference in absorbance between left and right circularly polarized light is a very powerful 
method because only the complex gives rise to an absorption spectrum, an effect which 
is called induced circular dichroism (ICD). In fact, two conditions should be met to obtain 
a signal: ﬁ rst, a chromophore absorbing UV or visible light, a condition fulﬁ lled only by 
the diazirine and second, a center of chirality, e.g., as observed in cyclodextrins. Titration 
experiments allow the determination of the strength of the complex and the stoichiometry 
is obtained by the method of continuous variation. Moreover, information can be obtained 
about the orientation of the chromophore in relation to the cyclodextrin depending on the 
sign of the ICD effect (Figure  10.2 ). According to Harata ’ s rule 37   which is based on the 
Kirkwood – Tinoco 38   theory of polarizabilities, a positive sign of the ICD effect means that 
the transition dipole moment vector of the chromophore is parallel to the symmetry axis 
of the cyclodextrin, whereas a negative sign is caused by a perpendicular arrangement. 
Harata ’ s rule is valid for an aromatic chromophore located inside the cavity; in case where 
the chromophore is situated outside, the signs are reversed, according to Kodaka ’ s rule. 39 
 During the past twenty years, signiﬁ cant work has been performed. Several carbenes 
have been studied in order to observe changes in their reactivity. Especially the supra-

molecular chemistry of 4 - oxocyclohexa - 2,5 - dienylidene 40 , 2 - methylcyclohexylidene, 3 - 
nortricyclanylidene, cyclooctylidene, chlorophenylcarbene, and adamantanylidene was 
investigated. 41 
 10.4.3.1  4 - Oxocyclohexa - 2,5 - dienylidene 
 4 - Oxocyclohexa - 2,5 - dienylidene ( 48 ) is known as an intermediate in the degradation of 
4 - chlorophenol ( 46 ), a widespread organic pollutant. Carbene  48  is generated by photoin-
duced dehalogenation (  λ  =  280  nm) of  46 and is relatively long - lived ( ca. 1  µ s) in water 
because this triplet carbene is reluctant to abstract hydrogen from OH groups (Scheme 
 10.16 ). 40   Depending on the reaction conditions, carbene  48  can be trapped efﬁ ciently 
either by oxygen to form  p - benzoquinone ( 50 ) through the intermediacy of benzoquinone -
 O - oxide ( 49 ). It can also be scavenged as biphenyl  54  by reaction with the starting mate-
rial, or as hydroquinone ( 53 ) by reaction with water, or can be trapped by an alkene. In 
an aqueous cyclodextrin (CD) solution, however, the usual reaction pathway to benzo-
quinone  50  is hampered; instead, phenol ( 52 ) is obtained. In the presence of CDs, although 
the association constants are rather small (140   M  − 1  for   α - CD and 300  M  − 1  for   β - CD), 
carbene  48  becomes difﬁ cult to trap. Instead, hydrogen abstraction from the host strongly 
dominates to form phenol ( 52 ). This is especially true for   α - CD: a 0.03  M solution of 
 α  - CD (83% complexation) yields 91% of phenol even in the presence of air. Indeed, the 
rate constant for the quenching of triplet  48  by   α - CD ( k q  =  5.7  ×  10 8  M  − 1  s  − 1 ) is very high. 
This is not only due to the good hydrogen donor property of secondary alcohols but also 
to the conﬁ nement in the narrow cavity of   α  - CD as revealed by a comparison with the 
signiﬁ cantly slower hydrogen abstraction from alcohols or glucose ( k q  =  8.5  ×  10 6  M  − 1  s  − 1 ). 
In fact, the life - time of  48  is impressively reduced to a few tens of nanoseconds in the 
presence of cyclodextrin. Photolysis in the solid state also leads to phenol ( 52 ). 42

Molecular Encapsulation
 The selectivity of an intramolecular carbene reaction is very strongly dependent on the 
conformation of the molecule, due to the high reactivity of the divalent carbon and its 
poor selectivity. If a carbene precursor or the carbene entrapped within a cavity is forced 
to take on a different conformation than the one prevailing in the liquid state, new products 
can be expected. For molecules with functional groups, a change in the geometry can be 
enforced by using noncovalent interactions like hydrogen bonds, dipole – dipole, or ion –
 ion interactions. For alkanes only few strategies remain; a convex structure can be built 
up to press the alkyl groups into a speciﬁ c pocket 43   or the hydrophobic effect can be 
employed to compress apolar units into the cavity of a host (Figure  10.3 ).  44 These 
approaches have proven to be successful for the packing of alkyl chains into reduced 
space. Alkyl chains which are normally fully extended in solution (all  anti ) can be forced 
to coil to a helix in order to ﬁ t into the available restricted space. Use of polarizable side 
walls slightly helps the change in conformation by increasing van - der - Waals interactions 
and C − H/  π  interactions. An example is the coiling of the alkyl chain of the anionic sur-
factant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in the anionic cavitand  55  in water. The coiling is 
monitored best by NMR spectroscopy as the CH 2  protons are strongly shifted upﬁ eld 
when they are placed in proximity of an aromatic ring and by NOE measurements which 
allow determining the size of the helix in the most representative conformation. In the 
case of  SDS @ 55 , an eight - carbon helix seems to be present together with a few percent 
of a six - carbon helix. Of course, due to the ﬂ exibility of the alkyl chain and the fact that 
an optimally ﬁ lled cavity should have a packing coefﬁ cient of only 55%,  45 rapid changes 
in the conformation still occur. The energetic cost for the coiling process has been esti-
mated at circa 0.5   kcal ⋅ mol  − 1 for each  gauche interaction.

and their propensity to react with a wide range of bonds that are suitably aligned, the 
presence of a different conformer of the reactive intermediate should lead to a different 
product distribution. For an efﬁ cient hydrogen shift, the ﬁ lled molecular orbital of the 
breaking CH bond (HOMO) should be aligned with the empty orbital at the carbenic 
center (LUMO). In  57 ax , the arrangement of the orbitals is much more favorable for a 
1,3 - CH insertion which would produce norcarane  58 . Moreover, formation of alkene  59 
should be hampered. Unfortunately, starting from diazirine  56 , no signiﬁ cant change is 
obtained;  58 is not formed and the alkene ratio does not signiﬁ cantly vary (Table  10.1 ). 
 The intermediates being electron - deﬁ cient, formation of alkene  59  is always favored 
in accordance with Saytzeff ’ s rule. The highest yield of  59  is obtained from the solid state 
photolysis of  56 @ α  - CD owing to a relative high  59  :  60  ratio and the absence of inter-
molecular products.  
 10.4.3.3  3 - Nortricyclanylidene 
 Similarly, 3 - nortricyclanylidene ( 66 ) was studied to obtain some evidence for an operat-
ing corset effect imposed by the macrocyclic host.  48   In the gas phase and also in solution, 
 66 ring - opens to 4 - ethynylcyclopentene ( 67 ) via cyclopropylcarbene fragmentation, a 
reaction which causes a signiﬁ cant change in the geometry of the guest (Scheme  10.19 ). 
It was expected that generating carbene  66  in the nanopore of a cyclodextrin would favor 
the formation of quadricyclane ( 69 ) through a 1,3 - CH insertion in analogy to the reactivity 
of 2 - norbornanylidene ( 73 ) affording  68  in a nearly quantitative yield.  49 However,  69 was 
never observed from any reaction of the cyclodextrin complexes. Instead and in contrast 
to the results obtained with methylcyclohexylidene  57 , a very signiﬁ cant amount of the 
carbene  66  reacted with the OH groups at the rims of cyclodextrins ( 71 : 52% with   β - CD 
and 80% with  α - CD, Table  10.2 ). This ﬁ nding can be explained by the difference in the 
life - time of carbenes  57  and  66 , respectively. Whereas  57  can rearrange very easily to an 
alkene by a 1,2 - H - shift, this pathway does not exist for  66 . As an alternative, the cleavage 
of the three - membered ring requires to overcome a considerable energy barrier. This 
leaves more time for the guest to react innermolecularly with the host. An intriguing result 
is the formation of the signiﬁ cant amount (14%) of nortricyclane ( 68 ) in the narrow and 
rigid cavity of  α - CD. Product  68  is caused by a twofold abstraction of hydrogen. However, 
insertion of the carbene into a CH bond of the host does not occur, a reaction that up to 
now has never been observed with cyclodextrins. Formation of azine  70  in   β - CD suggests 
that  65 @ β  - CD crystallizes in a head - to - head arrangement with two diazirine groups 
facing each other.

 10.4.3.4  Adamantanylidene 
 Photolyses of the   α - ,   β - , and   γ - cyclodextrin complexes  74 @CD of 2 - aziadamantane ( 74 ) 
in the solid state indeed afforded markedly different product distributions and also dif-
ferent inclusion geometries (Figure  10.4 ).  51,52 The complexes  74 @CD have been investi-
gated in detail using ICD.  53   This study performed in aqueous solutions shows that whereas 
the diazirine group in  74 @ β - CD and  60 @ γ - CD is placed in the vicinity of polar OH 
groups, the diazirine function in  74 @(  α - CD) 2 is located in an apolar microenvironment 
as is revealed by the ﬁ ne structure of its CD and UV spectrum. Moreover, for  74 @(  α -
 CD) 2 , a very large ICD (  ∆ ε  ∞   =  − 0.732  M  − 1  cm  − 1  at 380   nm) is obtained due to strong 
interaction of the guest with the chiral cyclodextrin. This is in contrast to the weak absorp-
tion measured for  74 @ γ  - CDs which can be explained by the increased mobility of the 
guest  74 in the large and more ﬂ exible cavity of   γ - CD. 52 The validity of computational 
calculations of host – guest complexes has been questioned. 54 Titration experiments have 
revealed the thermodynamic parameters of the 2 - aziadamantane   β - CD complex; it has 
also been shown that the results obtained are in good agreement with molecular dynamics 
simulations of this complex under explicit consideration of water molecules.  55 These dif-
ferences in the strength of the complex are found again chemically: the reactivities of the 
enclosed adamantanylidene diverge signiﬁ cantly (Scheme  10.20 and Table  10.3 ). 51,52 
 Especially the 1   :   2 complex formed with   α  - cyclodextrin leads to a drastic modiﬁ cation 
of the product distribution. Due to a complete encapsulation of the guest, formation of 
azine  78  is totally inhibited, thus inner -  and intramolecular reaction pathways are favored.

 Scheme 10.20   Products obtained from adamantanylidene  75 
However, within the conﬁ ned environment, the 1,3 C − H insertion reaction of carbene  75 
is not favored; the yield of didehydroadamantane ( 76 ) remains low (9%) and CH - insertions 
into the host do not occur as well. Instead, the production of adamantane ( 77 ) is strongly 
enhanced and reaches 31%. The formation of  77  is particularly facilitated by the fact that 
the singlet - triplet gap in adamantanylidene  75  is low (3.1 to 4.8   kcal   mol  − 1 ). 56 Although

 75  has been generated as a singlet and generally reacts as a singlet, the speciﬁ c steric 
constraints prevailing in the rigid cavity of two   α  - CDs hamper concerted insertion reac-
tions which have high requirements on the alignment of the orbitals involved in the reac-
tion. Instead, intersystem crossing and hydrogen abstraction are favored. Accordingly, 
oxidized  α  - CD is also recovered. This pathway is more signiﬁ cant for adamantanylidene 
 75  than for nortricyclanylidene  66  because  66  has a larger singlet - triplet gap due to a 
higher ring strain. In fact, the main reaction of  75 corresponds to an etheriﬁ cation of the 
secondary rim of the cyclodextrin (39% for  81 - 3 ′  and 19% for  81 - 2 ′ ). The predilection 
for reaction at position 3 corresponds to the geometrical requirement of the most stable 
conformation of the alkylated cyclodextrins  81 . In  81 - 3 ′ , the adamantyl group preferably 
remains directly on the top of the cavity, whereas in  81 – 2 ′ , it points outwards. Reaction 
with the primary hydroxy group at C6 does not occur. The photolyses of the 1   :   1 com-
plexes with   β - and   γ  - CD afford a wider range of products.  52   First of all, with   β - and   γ - CD, 
etheriﬁ cation at C6 is geometrically possible and does happen. With  74 @ β - CD, even two 
adamantyl groups can react with the hydroxy functions of the same cyclodextrin molecule. 
Second, the main product is azine  78  along with adamantanone ( 79 ) which probably arises 
from the hydrolysis of an intermediate on the way to azine  78  or directly from  78 . 52 And 
ﬁ nally, it is worth noticing that the yield of adamantanol  80  very strongly depends on the 
dryness of the hygroscopic cyclodextrin complexes. Overall, the ICD spectra and the 
products obtained from photolysis of 2 - aziadamantane ( 74 ) in CD allow to draw conclu-
sions about the supramolecular structure. Indeed, the results are mostly compatible with 
a head - to - head arrangement of the cyclodextrins in the  74 @(  α - CD) 2  complex (Figure 
 10.4 ). For the  β  - CD complex, the major product being azine  78 , a 2  :  2 structure is more 
likely (Figure  10.4 ). Such a combination of CDs would be the analogue of the structure 
determined by X - ray analysis for the complex of 5 - hydroxy - 2 - aziadamantane with   β - CD 50 
(Figure  10.5 ).

 10.4.3.5  Arylcarbenes 
 The following example emphasizes the fact that to observe drastic changes in the reactiv-
ity, encapsulation in a host molecule is not compulsory. It is often sufﬁ cient to perform 
the reaction in a constrained system under the condition that the adequate conformation 
is present. Thus, striking results have been obtained starting from 1 - (1,1 ′ - biphenyl - 4 - yl) -
 1 - diazo - 2 - phenylpropane ( 82 ). Although photolysis of  82  in solution yields a complex 
mixture of products resulting from hydrogen and phenyl shifts, photolysis in the solid 
state is highly stereoselective and affords almost exclusively the ( Z ) - alkene  84 (Scheme 
 10.21 ) as a consequence of the conformational constraints of the crystal packing which 
are nearly the same in the reactant and in the ( Z ) - product. 57   Moreover, the migrating 
hydrogen is already perfectly aligned with the empty p orbital of the carbene intermediate 
 83 and no rotation is required for the 1,2 hydrogen shift. 
 10.4.3.6  Chloro(phenyl)carbene 
 Attempts were also made to observe the rearrangement of chloro(phenyl)carbene ( 86 ) to 
1 - chloro - 1,2,4,6 - cycloheptatetraene ( 87 ) in the cavity of cyclodextrins.  58 Starting from 
diazirine  85 , the rearrangement to  87  can indeed be observed in an argon matrix at 10   K.  59 
Under preparative conditions, 100% of azine  88  is obtained. What would happen in a 
molecular capsule? Reactive intermediate  86  belongs to the category of carbenes that are 
particularly suitable for intermolecular reactions as a result of the absence of a reaction 
pathway like the common hydrogen shifts leading to the formation of alkenes. As a con-
sequence, carbene  86 possesses a relatively long life - time (3.6  µ s in isooctane) 60 and 
prefers to react with the OH groups of CDs yielding almost exclusively benzaldehyde 
( 89 ) (Scheme  10.22 ). 58

 This high propensity of entrapped carbenes to react with native   α - and   β - cyclodextrin 
motivated us to search for more inert hosts. Therefore, after a few experiments with 
hydrophilic cyclodextrins derivatives, i.e., permethylated cyclodextrins (TRIMEB in the 
case of  β - CD, TRIMEA for  α - CD) were performed successfully as molecular reactors 
for supramolecular carbene chemistry.  61   This is due to their ready availability,  62 their high 
solubility in water and in organic solvents and their good crystallization properties. The 
absence of OH groups at the rims of TRIMEB makes this host inert toward reactions of 
carbenes. However, owing to the lack of intramolecular hydrogen bridges, TRIMEB is 
more ﬂ exible and forms less stable complexes with lower association constants in com-
parison to native   β - cyclodextrin. 61 
 10.4.3.7  Bicyclo[3.2.1]octan - 8 - ylidenes 
 The most recent experiments have been performed with 3 - substituted bicyclo[3.2.1]octan -
 8 - ylidenes  91 . These carbenes were chosen because of their symmetry. In the presence 
of a chiral host these achiral intermediates could give rise to chiral products  92  and  93 
(Scheme  10.23 ). The aim of this study was to determine whether the intrinsically chiral 
cyclodextrin hosts are able to cause the formation of one enantiomer over the other.  63 The 
unsubstituted bicyclo[3.2.1]octan - 8 - ylidene ( 91 ) reacts exclusively through 1,3 - CH inser-
tion to tricyclooctane  92 . 64 For the 3 - endo - substituted carbenes  91 , a second reaction 
pathway becomes competitive yielding bicyclo[3.3.0]octene  93  by a 1,2 alkyl shift. It was 
found that not only the host is able to induce a modest enantiomeric excess but the corset 
effect of the host can also signiﬁ cantly alter the bicyclooctene :tricyclooctane ratio  93  :  92 
(Table  10.4 ). Once again, the rigid and narrow bowl of   α  - CD exerts the strongest inﬂ u-
ence on the guest.  90b @(  α - CD) 2  is the complex for which the highest ee (8%) is obtained. 
Also the formation of  93 is preferred over  92 . 63 
 For  90b @TRIMEB, a single crystal suitable for X - ray analysis could be grown (Figure 
 10.6 ). 61   The structure obtained ascertains the complete separation of one guest molecule 
from another and explains why azine  94  is lacking in the product mixture resulting from 
the photolysis of  90b @TRIMEB.  90b @TRIMEB is a good example for a complex for

hydroxy group of the guest is positioned in the middle of the cyclodextrin cavity forming 
a hydrogen bridge with a glucosidic oxygen atom. In contrast, in an aqueous solution, the

 10.4.4  Nitrenes 
 Our knowledge about supramolecular nitrene chemistry and the reactivity of these inter-
mediates in a constrained system is still in its infancy: even though nitrenes are widely 
used for photoafﬁ nity labelling. 65   However, the exact structures of the products formed 
after reaction with the active sites are often unknown. Therefore, a better understanding 
of the binding properties of a nitrene precursor within the host molecule is necessary. 
Moreover, it is essential to learn which reactions still do occur inside a supramolecular 
structure. 
 Azides  96  are the most popular precursors for nitrenes  97 , which can be generated 
either thermally or photochemically.  66   In a nitrene, the nitrogen atom is monovalent and 
possesses a sextet of electrons in its outer shell. Therefore, nitrenes are highly reactive 
intermediates. Usually, they are generated as singlets with paired electrons. However, 
intersystem crossing to the diradical triplet ground state is quite fast. (Scheme  10.24 ) 
 The most characteristic reaction of nitrenes consists of secondary amine  98 formation 
by insertion into C − H bonds either in a concerted process for singlets or through hydrogen 
abstraction followed by recombination of the radical couple for triplets, a process called 
pseudoinsertion. An even more efﬁ cient reaction is the addition to alkenes to form aziri-
dines. For singlets, this addition is concerted and thus stereoselective. Whereas for triplets, 
the reaction proceeds through a stepwise mechanism involving radicals and therefore is 
not stereoselective. Further typical reactions are double hydrogen abstraction of triplet 
nitrenes to afford primary amines  100 and formation of azo compound  99 by reaction 
with the azide precursor or by dimerization when the nitrene concentration is high. 
 Our group has investigated the behavior of nitrenes enclosed in host molecules. 
For this purpose, we have obtained initial results with adamantyl nitrenes which can be 
generated either thermally or photochemically from readily available adamantane azides.  67

Two main reasons guided this choice. On one hand, the reactions of these compounds 
under classical conditions are already known. This facilitates to ﬁ nd out, how nitrene 
reactivity has been modiﬁ ed by inclusion. On the other hand, as has been shown earlier 
in this chapter, the adamantane skeleton is a good ﬁ t for the cavity of   α - and   β - cyclodextrins 
leading to high association constants upon complexation. 
 10.4.4.1  1 - Adamantanyl nitrene 
 1 - Adamantanyl nitrene ( 102 ) is generated by photolysis of 1 - adamantane azide ( 101 ). 
Nitrene  102  rearranges by an alkyl shift to the unstable imine  103 (Scheme  10.25 ). The 
C = N double bond is quite reactive because it is located at a bridge - head. Therefore,  103 
dimerizes to azetidine  105  in a head - to - tail fashion in an alkane solution or in the solid 
state. 68 
 In   α  -  and also in   β  - cyclodextrin, the outcome of the reaction is totally different because 
dimerization to  105  cannot occur. Instead, during the aqueous work - up the hemiaminal 
4 - azahomoadamantan - 3 - ol ( 104 ) is formed by addition of water to the bridge - head imine 
(Table  10.5 ). 
 10.4.4.2  2 - Adamantanyl nitrene 
 2 - Adamantane azide ( 106 ) behaves similarly (Scheme  10.26 ): after generation of nitrene 
 107 , the main reaction consists of a 1,2 - alkyl shift to form 4 - azahomoadamant - 4 - ene ( 108 ) 
which can be isolated.  69   As a side product, adamantane imine ( 109 ) is produced through

a 1,2 - H shift in  107 . Compound  109  easily hydrolyzes to afford adamantanone ( 79 ). When 
nitrene  107 is generated inside the cyclodextrin cavity, very similar results are obtained 
(Table  10.6 ). In any case, both adamantanyl nitrenes did not form any isolable innermo-
lecular products with   α - or  β - cyclodextrin. 
 10.4.4.3  Ferrocenyl nitrene 
 The third case study concerns ferrocenyl nitrene. The geometry of the inclusion com-
plexes of its precursor inside   α - and   β - cyclodextrins was thoroughly investigated using 
induced circular dichroism, quantum mechanical and NMR studies.  70   Because of the poor 
solubility of these complexes in water, alternative solvents had to be employed. Aprotic 
polar solvents like DMSO and DMF possess the best solubilizing properties but at the 
cost of low association constants. Ethylene glycol is a better compromise between binding 
and solubilizing properties. 
 Indeed, the behavior of ferrocenyl azide inside   β  - cyclodextrin is striking, since the 
alignment of the guest changes depending on the solvent and the temperature (Figure 
 10.7 ). In ethylene glycol and in DMSO/H 2 O 50/50, a negative ICD is obtained which 
results from an axial orientation according to Harata ’ s rule (Figure  10.8 , Structure A). 
With DMSO contents higher than 62%, the ICD band is positive, ferrocenyl azide adopts 
an equatorial arrangement (Structure B). Structure B is also favored at higher temperatures 
as can be shown by the sign reversal of the ICD spectra between 10 and 40    ° C (Figure 
 10.7 B). The proposed geometries of inclusion are also corroborated by 2D ROESY spec-
troscopy (Table  10.7 ).

 Finally, the ferrocenyl complexes were decomposed photochemically and thermally. 
Thermolyses can be performed in this case because the decomposition temperature of 
the azide ( 96 ) (80  ° C) is much lower than those employed for other diazirines and azides. 
The results obtained from photolyses and thermolyses do not differ signiﬁ cantly. Here 
again,  α  - CD causes the most drastic changes because of the complete encapsulation of 
the guest in a 1   :   2 complex (Scheme  10.27 ). In accord with the other reactions performed 
in  α  - CD, the main reaction pathway is hydrogen abstraction from the host. Upon ther-
molysis ferrocenyl amine ( 112 ) is obtained in a yield up to 60%. More remarkably, 
ferrocenyl nitrene ( 111 ) seems to react in very low yields with   α - CD. However, the 
structure of the reaction product  113  has not been fully established yet and is quite 
unexpected because  113  is the result of a glucopyranose - furanose conversion. In contrast,

(Figure  10.9 , orientation A) whereas in the other half this group is pointing toward the 
secondary rim (orientation B).  67 
 10.4.4.4  Phenylnitrene 
 Phenylnitrene ( 117 ) can be generated as a singlet from phenyl azide ( 116 ) under UV 
irradiation. Below 165   K, intersystem crossing to the triplet state occurs. Otherwise, an 
alkyl shift leads to the formation of the easily polymerizing 1 - azacyclohepta - 1,2,4,6 -
 tetraene ( 118 ), (Scheme  10.28 ) a compound which is in equilibrium with singlet phenyl-
nitrene. 71   Finally, the nitrene may be trapped if suitable compounds are present, e.g. 
formation of azobenzene ( 119 ) by reaction with phenyl azide. Otherwise, hydrogen 
abstraction affords aniline ( 120 ) and polymerization products are often obtained.  72 
Interestingly, the chemical behavior of phenylnitrene is strongly altered when this inter-
mediate is generated inside the resorcin[4]arene - based cavitand  121 . 72 Especially,  121 can 
be functionalized regioselectively depending on the structure of the complex. 
 The complex  116 @ 121  is obtained in a 1.5   :   1 stoichiometry by crystallization from a 
saturated solution of cavitand  121  in phenyl azide ( 116 ) and drying at 25    ° C (18  h at 
0.4   Torr). Irradiation of the 1.5   :   1 complex of  116 @ 121  leads to the formation of  N -
 alkylaniline  122 as the major product (35%) through a regioselective C − H insertion of 
phenylnitrene into one of the alkyl chains (Scheme  10.29 ). The formation of product  122 
is a strong hint that in  116 @ 121  excess of phenyl azide is located between the alkyl 
chains. The major secondary product is azobenzene ( 119 ) (22%). This relatively high 
yield of dimerization product can be explained by the speciﬁ c packing found in the crystal 
structure of  116 @ 121 , namely a head - to - head arrangement in which two azido groups 
are in close proximity. 
 DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) analysis reveals how a 1   :   1 complex can be 
obtained (Figure  10.10 ). Indeed, two dissociation processes are observed. First, excess 
phenyl azide is lost between 70 and 125    ° C (  ∆ H  =  4.0  kcal  mol  − 1 ). Second, the remaining 
1  :  1 complex dissociates at 142  ° C with a fairly high   ∆ H of 13.1  kcal  mol  − 1 . It is worth 
noticing that MPWB1K/6 - 31+G(d,p) calculations (  ∆ H  =  11.1  kcal  mol  − 1 ) are in good 
agreement with the experimental results concerning the orientation of the guest and the 
strength of the interactions.

 For synthetic purposes, the 1.5   :   1 complex can be treated thermally at 112    ° C for 35  min 
at 1   atm to furnish  116 @ 121 as a 1  :  1 complex (Figure  10.11 ). Its photolysis does not 
afford any C − H insertion product  122 . Instead, phenylnitrene adds to a quinoxaline ring 
and yields the two diastereomeric aziridines  123  (31%) and  124  (7%) together with 
azobenzene ( 119 ) (11%). This high regioselectivity and even the aziridine formation can 
only be obtained using solid state photolysis and are the result of the restricted motion of 
the nitrene in the cavitand. Indeed, photolysis of phenyl azide in presence of 10 equiv of 
quinoxaline in benzene affords only aniline ( 120 ) (17%) and azobenzene ( 119 ) (9%). The 
azanorcaradienes  123  and/or  124  can be converted into azepine  126  upon heating via a 
1,5 - sigmatropic nitrogen migration to aziridine  125  followed by valence isomerization 
(Scheme  10.30 ). Irradiation of azepine  126  affords back the aziridines  123  and  124  in a 
ratio of 1  :  5; this reaction chain allows reversing the ratio of  123  :  124 . 
 In conclusion, the generation of reactive intermediates in the cavity of a supramolecular 
structure offers a straightforward approach to the preparation of functionalized hosts as 
can be seen for example from the results obtained from the different regioselective modi-
ﬁ cations of a resorcin[4]arene cavitand by phenylnitrene.  72 The properties of the guest 
can be signiﬁ cantly changed: intersystem - crossing can be enforced and therefore a carbene 
can be coerced to react as a triplet. Accordingly, the reactivity may vary greatly. Moreover,

as a trend, the encapsulated intermediates tend to be less reactive, especially in intermo-
lecular reactions and toward the inner side of the host. This is partly due to the steric 
requirement for the reaction and also due to the need to have an optimal alignment of the 
orbitals of the reactant. As a consequence of the conﬁ nement in a constrained system, 
these reactions are slowed down. However, especially in rigidly and densely packed 
complexes, some reactions which do not have strong requirements on the geometry of 
the transition state are strongly accelerated, e.g., electron transfer or hydrogen abstraction. 
Indeed, the narrow cavity of   α  - CD has proven to be a very efﬁ cient hydrogen donor 
toward triplet intermediates and radicals favoring the reduction of the guest.

 11.1  Introduction 
 Organic dyes have been used throughout the ages as pigments in everyday items like 
paints, clothing, and printed matter. More recently, ﬂ uorescent dyes have emerged as 
crucial components in many high technology devices such as secure banknotes, lasing 
media, optical data storage, biomedical probes, and environmental sensors. A critical issue 
in all of these applications is dye performance, which can be judged by several parameters 
such as chemical stability, photochemical stability, colour intensity, ﬂ uorescence quantum 
yield, solubility, toxicity, etc. The systematic development of organic dyes has been 
pursued since the ﬁ rst reported synthesis of Indigo by von Baeyer in 1882,  1 an accom-
plishment which set in motion the German chemical industry.  2 In recent times, interest 
in ﬂ uorescent dyes has increased dramatically due to their growing impact in biotechnol-
ogy and nanotechnology. It is worth noting that ﬂ uorescent dyes were a central component 
in the large scale sequencing methods that mapped the human genome, one of mankind ’ s 
most impressive scientiﬁ c achievements. 3 
 The most obvious way to alter dye performance is to synthetically modify the covalent 
structure. However, despite the continued advances in synthetic organic chemistry, the 
process of dye synthesis is still a tedious task that consumes materials and human 
resources. As a way of circumventing this problem, supramolecular chemists have started

Molecular Encapsulation
to explore non - covalent methods for altering dye properties. The focus of this chapter is 
on mechanical encapsulation of dyes inside: (a) protective organic container molecules 
such as cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, cyclophanes, and crown ethers (Scheme  11.1 ), (b) 
biological receptors such as antibodies, aptamers and peptides, and (c) inorganic cages 
such as zeolites and silica nanoparticles. In some cases the dye binding process is revers-
ible and produces a host – guest complex that is in equilibrium with the free species; in 
other cases the mechanical bonding is so strong that the host – guest complex can be con-
sidered a permanent molecule. Upon encapsulation, the microenvironment around the dye 
is changed, which often alters the absorption wavelength or the ﬂ uorescence quantum 
yield. Further, the dye is sterically protected, thus inhibiting intermolecular processes that 
often degrade dye performance like self - aggregation which reduces brightness and colour 
purity and photooxidation which leads to bleaching. Steric protection of long wavelength 
dyes is expected to be particularly helpful, because these dyes inherently have narrow 
HOMO – LUMO gaps and thus tend to be highly reactive.

Dye Encapsulation 
311
 There are various practical reasons to develop supramolecular methods of dye encap-
sulation. Reversible dye binding systems can be incorporated into dynamic association 
schemes that produce changes in colour or ﬂ uorescence emission. Thus, they can act as 
analytical sensing processes for environmental assays or as molecular probes for cell 
biology. Permanent encapsulation inside a container molecule can be achieved by several 
rotaxane synthesis methods that have been developed over the last twenty years.  4 These 
dye rotaxanes can act as bright and highly stable ﬂ uorescent probes for diagnostics and 
bioimaging applications. Another way to make a bioimaging agent is to use a genetically 
expressible bioreceptor such as an antibody or aptamer with a recognition motif that 
selectively binds a dye with high afﬁ nity. 5   These tagged bioreceptors can be visualized 
by ﬂ uorescence microscopy and used as imaging agents in cell biology research. Finally,

 11.2  Reversible Dye Encapsulation Inside Organic Container Molecules 
 Organic container molecules are large macrocycles whose internal cavities can accom-
modate guest molecules. Historically, the most studied family of water - soluble container 
molecules are the cyclodextrins (CDs) which have non - polar cavities that can accom-
modate organic dyes of appropriate size and insulate them from an aqueous solvent. The 
three most common CDs are  α - CD,   β - CD and   γ  - CD with cavity diameters of 5.7, 7.8 and 
9.5  Å respectively. 7 Encapsulation of ﬂ uorescent dyes inside a CD typically improves 
chemical and photochemical stability and also raises the ﬂ uorescence quantum yield. 
However, a drawback with CD encapsulation is the relatively weak association constant 
( K a  ∼  10 3 − 10 4  M  − 1 ) which can be readily disrupted. This has prompted a move in recent 
years to the cucurbit[n]uril (CB) family of container molecules which have much higher 
dye afﬁ nities in water and, like CDs, possess different diameters depending upon the 
number of repeating subunits in the macrocycle.  8   For example, the association constant 
for the dye Rhodamine in water is 50,000   M  − 1  with cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) but only 
210  M  − 1  with   β - CD. 9   The Rhodamine inclusion complex, in addition to possessing greater 
chemical stability and reduced dye aggregation, also exhibits properties distinct from 
uncomplexed Rhodamine dyes including longer ﬂ uorescence lifetimes and decreased 
nonspeciﬁ c adsorption to surfaces.  10   The inclusion complex appears quite suitable for dye 
based lasers, which operate most efﬁ ciently with aqueous lasing media. An aqueous solu-
tion of Rhodamine 6G complexed inside CB[7] produces better beam shape proﬁ les when 
compared to free Rhodamine 6G in ethanol. CB[7] can also be used in stoichiometric 
ratios and thus it negligibly impacts the refractive qualities of the water, unlike detergents 
and emulsiﬁ ers, which also produce a dye deaggregating effect, but adversely affects 
performance due to bubble and foam formation.  11 
 Related studies have shown that CB[7] binds fused tricyclic dyes such as Proﬂ avine, 
Pyronine Y, and Thionine with higher association constants than the analogous CD, and 
that dye encapsulation increases the ﬂ uorescence quantum yield.  12   In contrast to CB[7], 
the larger CB[8] encapsulates two dye molecules while the smaller CB[5] does not 
effectively encapsulate any tricyclic dye. In Figure  11.1 , the perceived colour of the dye

solution is altered by these encapsulation processes. This colour difference is attributed 
to changes in polarity induced by encapsulation and, when CB[8] is used, changes in 
dye aggregation. Separate studies have shown that CB[7] can also encapsulate Brilliant 
Green, a ﬂ uorescent antimicrobial trimethane dye, and form a 1   :   1 association complex 
with a binding constant of 17,000   M  − 1 . Intriguingly, the ﬂ uorescence quantum yield for 
the inclusion complex is further enhanced when it associates with bovine serum albumin 
(Figure  11.2 ). 13 
 Reversible dye binding systems can be developed into colourimetric and ﬂ uorescent 
assays for analytical detection. As shown in Figure  11.3 , two different binding schemes 
can be envisioned, (a) competitive dye/analyte inclusion, and (b) cooperative dye/analyte 
inclusion. The competitive inclusion process is the basis for the  ‘ dye displacement assay ’ 
where the analyte displaces the dye from the container molecule. For this process to be 
visualized, the properties of complexed and uncomplexed dyes must be markedly dif-

ferent. For example, CB[7] and the ﬂ uorescent dye Dapoxyl have been incorporated into 
an assay that monitors the activity of amino acid decarboxylase enzymes. 14 At pH 6, 
Dapoxyl has a relatively high afﬁ nity for CB[7] ( K a  =  20,000  M  − 1 ) and it is over 200 
times more ﬂ uorescent when inside the CB[7] cavity. Zwitterionic amino acids have 
much lower binding afﬁ nities for CB[7] ( K a  <  1,000  M  − 1 ) and cannot displace the dye, 
but the presence of amino acid decarboxylase leads to decarboxylated cationic products 
that have substantially stronger afﬁ nities for CB[7] ( ∼ 30,000  M  − 1 ). The overall scheme 
is a  ‘ switch off ’  assay, where the product of enzyme action displaces the dye from the 
container molecule which decreases the ﬂ uorescence intensity. In general,  ‘ switch on ’ 
ﬂ uorescence assays are technically easier to monitor but they are harder to devise because 
most dyes are more ﬂ uorescent when they are encapsulated. A rare example uses the 
dye 2,3 - diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct - 2 - ene (DBO), which is less ﬂ uorescent when it is bound 
to a  p - sulfonatocalix[4]arene macrocycle. 14   The action of amino acid decarboxylase leads 
to displacement of the DBO dye from the macrocycle and an eight - fold increase in ﬂ uo-
rescence intensity. 
 The other binding scheme in Figure  11.3  is cooperative dye/analyte inclusion, where 
the analyte promotes association of the dye inside the container molecule. Compared to 
dye displacement, this is a more complicated supramolecular system because it requires 
the container molecule to have multi - guest recognition properties. Proof - of - concept 
studies have been reported using crown ether cyclophanes as container molecules that 
can simultaneously bind two types of guests: ﬂ at aromatic dyes and metal cations. In 
Figure  11.4  is a crown ether derived naphthalene macrocycle whose weak afﬁ nity for a 
pyromellitic diimide is increased by an order of magnitude by the presence of lithium 
salts. 15   The crown ether oxygens coordinate to the lithium cations which in turn promotes 
simultaneous dye inclusion. The result is a stunning colour change from a pale yellow 
to bright red due to formation of a charge transfer complex. In principle, this multi - 
component assembly can be employed as a colorimetric sensor for lithium cations. 
 A related cooperative binding system is shown in Figure  11.5 . A crown ether derived 
macrocycle only binds a squaraine dye when sodium cations are present in the solution.  16 
The sodium cations bridge the dye and the crown ether oxygens inside the macrocyclic

cavity, an inclusion process that enhances the dye ’ s ﬂ uorescence. Addition of potassium 
cations leads to displacement of the sodium and consequent dye ejection from the cavity 
because the larger potassium ions bind to the cyclophane exterior and thus dye inclusion 
is no longer favoured. This multicomponent assembly system exhibits rudimentary char-
acteristics of a combination NOT/AND logic device where the presence of sodium alone 
causes ﬂ uorescence signal increase, but a mixture of sodium and excess potassium or 
potassium alone produces no change in ﬂ uorescence. 
 11.3  Reversible Dye Encapsulation by Biological Receptors 
 There is growing interest in biological receptors for ﬂ uorescent dyes, in particular, geneti-
cally expressed receptors such as proteins or oligonucleotides.  17   A major goal of this 
research is to discover high afﬁ nity dye recognition motifs that can be utilized for bio-
imaging applications. The recognition motif can be encoded into the sequence of a larger 
protein or oligonucleotide of interest where the dye can be used to non - covalently label 
the genetically expressed target in a living cell or animal. The initial challenge is to ﬁ nd 
the appropriate dye recognition motifs using standard biotechnology screening methods 
such as phage display, 18 yeast display, 19   or SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by 
exponential enrichment).  20   A recent example employed phage display technology to 
identify a 7 - mer peptide sequence (IQSPHFF) with subnanomolar afﬁ nity for a ﬂ uores-
cent near - IR benzindolium dye (Dye A in Figure  11.6 ).  21   Molecular modelling indicates 
that the peptide sequence forms a tweezer structure with two aromatic arms surrounding 
the ﬂ at dye. Incorporating the IQSPHFF sequence into larger protein structures allows

selective dye labelling in a range of assays including ELISA, ﬂ ow cytometry, high 
throughput screens, microscopy and  in vivo  imaging. However, a drawback with this 
protein labelling system is the small change in the dye emission wavelength and intensity 
that occurs upon binding which makes it difﬁ cult to distinguish between bound and 
unbound dye. This means there may be an undesirably high background signal which 
would lower the contrast. This problem can be minimized by using a dye whose ﬂ uores-
cence in free solution is weak but increases substantially upon association with the 
bioreceptor. Several antibodies have been identiﬁ ed that exhibit this ﬂ uorescence activat-
ing phenomenon. One example binds a stilbene derivative (dye B in Figure  11.6 ) produc-
ing a blue - emitting exciplex band due to interaction of the excited state stilbene with a 
ground - state tryptophan residue buried in the antibody.  22 Another research programme 
has used yeast display technology to identify single chain antibodies as ﬂ uorescence 
activating proteins.  23   The antibodies selectively bind target dyes such as dye C and 
increase the emission intensity by factors of several thousand. There has also been 
progress ﬁ nding RNA and DNA aptamers that bind dyes and raise quantum yields.  24 For 
example, a double - stranded RNA aptamer binds the cyanine dye D with  K a  =  10 7  M  − 1 and 
enhances the ﬂ uorescence quantum yield by 60 - fold. 25 
 11.4  Permanent Dye Encapsulation Inside Rotaxanes

from the host. The most common strategy for trapping a dye inside a container molecule

Molecular Encapsulation
is to form an interlocked structure known as a rotaxane. Rotaxane synthesis has improved 
greatly over the last few decades with the discovery and reﬁ nement of a number of tem-
plated reactions. The three most common methods for rotaxane formation are clipping, 
capping, and slipping (Figure  11.7 ), and each has its strengths and weaknesses. To date, 
much of the research effort on dye rotaxanes has focused on developing synthetic methods 
that are compatible with the reactive functional groups in organic dyes. Yields for the 
rotaxane formation step are often low (5 – 30%) and eventually they will have to be raised 
if dye rotaxanes are to be implemented in commercial applications. A promising approach 
that warrants further attention is to use solid - state synthesis methods (Figure  11.7 ). 26 
 The pioneering dye rotaxane synthesis, reported by Anderson and coworkers in 1996, 
utilized Glaser coupling under aqueous conditions in the presence of a water soluble 
cyclophane macrocycle to produce a mixture of [2] and [3]rotaxanes with a conjugated 
phenylacetylene ﬂ uorophore as the axle component (Figure  11.8 ).  27   The purpose of the 
encapsulation was to insulate the conjugated   π  - system from quenching processes and both 
rotaxanes were found to be six fold more ﬂ uorescent. 
 Many of the subsequent preparations of dye rotaxanes have employed CD as the pro-
tective macrocycle. In each case, a threaded complex is assembled in aqueous solution 
and a covalent capping reaction produces the permanently interlocked rotaxane. In Figures 
 11.9  and  11.10  are two capping reactions that encapsulate dyes inside CD to produce 
acene 28   and cyanine rotaxanes.  29   Similar methods have also been used to make phenyl-
acetylene, 30   and oligo(thiophene) rotaxanes.  31   With the larger   γ  - CD it is possible to 
simultaneously encapsulate two dyes and make homo - and hetero - [3]rotaxanes that can 
achieve extremely efﬁ cient energy transfer between the chromophores.  32 While water is 
a useful solvent for driving hydrophobic dyes into the CD cavity to make the precursor 
threaded complexes, it does limit the scope of the capping reactions in that they must be 
water compatible. 
 The acene [2]rotaxane in Figure  11.9  was prepared by mixing an anthracene bisboronic 
acid with   β  - CD in water and conducting a Suzuki capping reaction to produce the per-
manent rotaxane. Unlike the free acene axle, the rotaxane does not exhibit an excimer

Molecular Encapsulation
emission band at elevated concentration, indicating that the surrounding CD prevents 
self - aggregation of the acene chromophore. However, a dye rotaxane structure does not 
automatically prevent all types of bimolecular reactions with the encapsulated dye. For 
instance, anthracene is well known to undergo a [4+4] photodimerization process as well 
as a [4+2] cycloaddition with singlet oxygen to produce a bridged 9,10 - endoperoxide. A 
comparison of the reactivities of the acene axle component and the rotaxane in Figure 
 11.9  showed that the surrounding   β  - CD completely prevented the photodimerization 
process, but it only slowed the rate of photooxidation by about an order of magnitude. 
Thus, the chemical protection provided by the surrounding CD is diminished when the 
reactant is sterically small like molecular oxygen. 
 The difﬁ culty in preventing dye photooxidation is further illustrated by the cyanine 
rotaxane in Figure  11.10 . Cyanine dyes are a very popular class of red and near - IR ﬂ uo-
rescent dyes but they are susceptible to photobleaching. It is known that photogenerated 
singlet oxygen can decompose cyanine dyes by oxidative cleavage of the conjugated 
double bonds.  33   The capping reaction shown in Figure  11.10  has been optimized for gram 
scale production of the cyanine rotaxane which has similar photophysical properties as 
the free dye.  34   In terms of photostability, air saturated solutions of free dye decompose 
3.9 times faster than encapsulated dye, a modest amount of oxidative protection. The 
above two rotaxane examples demonstrate the difﬁ culty in sterically blocking dye photo-
oxidation. Future efforts to design high stability dye rotaxanes should be based on a clear 
understanding of the chemical and photochemical degradation processes and where they 
occur on the chromophore. By knowing what decomposition reactions to prevent, more 
effective encapsulation strategies can be developed. 
 The encapsulation of squaraine dyes as axle components inside rotaxanes has lead to 
some dramatic improvements in dye performance. Squaraines exhibit sharp, strong 
absorption and emission bands in the red and near - IR wavelengths and they are attractive 
dyes for bioimaging. 35 However, there are two serious limitations; they tend to form non -
 ﬂ uorescent aggregates and the dye ’ s electron deﬁ cient C 4 O 2  core is susceptible to chemi-
cal attack by nucleophiles.  36   Both of these drawbacks are overcome by dye inclusion 
inside a tetralactam macrocycle, a process that is driven by hydrogen bonding interactions 
with the squaraine oxygens. First - generation squaraine rotaxanes were prepared in 
20 – 30% yield by a templated clipping reaction in weakly polar organic solvent.  37 The 
rotaxanes exhibit very similar photophysical properties as the precursor squaraines, but 
the encapsulating macrocycle protects the dye from nucleophilic attack. For example, the 
unprotected squaraine loses its blue colour within minutes in serum solution while 
squaraine rotaxanes retain their colour for days. In addition, the surrounding tetralactam 
macrocycle diminishes squaraine absorption band broadening by inhibiting interchromo-
phoric interactions both in solution and solid state. 
 It is straightforward to conjugate cell targeting ligands to squaraine rotaxanes and 
produce ﬂ uorescence probes for bioimaging. For example, attachment of zinc coordinated 
dipicolylamine groups, which are known to target bacterial cell surfaces, produces a 
bright, photostable, and non - toxic probe for bacteria imaging.  38   This probe is over 20 
times more photostable than an analogous probe composed of the popular cyanine dye, 
Cy5. The enhanced photostability allows acquisition of ﬂ uorescent movies of bacterial 
cell division; these movies were previously unavailable due to photobleaching of the 
ﬂ uorescent probe. 39

 A series of second - generation squaraine rotaxanes can be produced using the anthrylene 
tetralactam macrocycle shown in Scheme  11.1 . The high solubility of this macrocycle in 
organic solvents allows squaraine rotaxanes to be produced in essentially quantitative 
yield by either a thermally promoted slipping process that forces the dye through the 
macrocyclic cavity,  40   or capping chemistry that covalently adds stopper groups to a self -
 assembled pseudo - rotaxane complex. 41   The tetralactam macrocycle wraps tightly around 
the squaraine dye and there is about a 40   nm red - shift in the emission wavelength, a 
phenomenon that has been observed with a related perylene diimide rotaxane system. 42

Thus, the structure of the surrounding macrocycle is a molecular design parameter 
that can be used to non - covalently ﬁ ne - tune the photophysical properties of the encapsu-
lated dye. 
 11.5  Permanent Encapsulation Inside Inorganic Matrices 
 A conceptually different way to permanently encapsulate dyes is to trap them inside 
inorganic cages.  43   The most straightforward approach is to employ preformed molecular 
sieves or zeolites. If the dye is smaller than the diameter of the pores then solution and 
gas phase diffusion techniques can be used to load the dye molecules inside the zeolite 
(Figure  11.13 ). Shown in Figure  11.14  is a more sophisticated approach, which assembles 
the dye inside the zeolite (i.e.  ‘ ship in a bottle synthesis ’ ) using a precursor molecule 
that is grafted to the cavity walls.  44   These dye doped inorganic materials can act as solar 
energy capture devices and as optical sensors. An example of the latter is a ﬂ uorescent 
humidity sensor based on Nile Red encapsulated inside NaY zeolite supercages.  45 The 
ﬂ uorescence of Nile Red is sensitive to solvent polarity and incorporation within the 
zeolitic pores further enhances this effect, partly because the zeolite cavities are 
hydrophilic.   
 Clay materials, like zeolites, have also been explored as naturally occurring micropo-
rous hosts for dyes.  46   Trapping the dyes within these three dimensional scaffolds provides 
protection from external quenchers but inhibits aggregation behaviour by immobilizing 
and segregating them within the framework of the material. Interestingly, dye encapsula-
tion within micro and mesoporous materials was performed by the ancient Mayas several 
thousand years ago. Indigo, a naturally derived blue dye extracted from many plants of 
the genus  Indigofera , has modest stability but encapsulation inside palygorskite clay 
produces a dye of exceptional stability, one that is inert to high and low pH solutions, 
photobleaching and oxidation. The packing arrangement of the dye within the clay is still 
a matter of investigation but computational and spectroscopic evidence suggests the 
zeolitic water in the clay is released upon inclusion of indigo and H - bond contacts

between the dye walls of the clay and structural water molecules (those molecules that 
make up the scaffold of the clay) form stabilizing interactions. 47 
 The desire to produce non - toxic ﬂ uorescent nanoparticles for bioimaging and diagnos-
tic applications has lead to new methods of doping dyes within the lattice structures of 
silica nanoparticles.  48   The trapped dyes exhibit enhanced stability, increased ﬂ uorescence, 
and decreased self - aggregation. A range of related microemulsion methods have been 
reported to produce dye - doped and core - shell silica nanoparticles.  49   In some cases, the 
dyes are covalently conjugated to the silicate precursor which leads to greater dye dis-
persal within the nanoparticle.  50   An alternative method employs a cationic surfactant to 
template the formation of mesoporous silica containing the molecularly dispersed dyes. 
Fluorescent silica nanoparticles are potentially useful as sensors for lab - on - chip diagnos-
tics and as probes for cell and animal imaging. Nanoparticle probes that contain photo-
sensitizing dyes are potential candidates for photodynamic therapy.  51 Most photosensitizing

dyes are hydrophobic, which leads to formulation problems and poor  in vivo distribution. 
Covalently attaching photosensitizers to the nanoparticles enables convenient delivery to 
tumor cells without the problem of dye diffusion away from the target site. Molecular 
oxygen can penetrate the pores of the nanoparticles, thus irradiation of the target site after 
nanoparticle delivery leads to singlet oxygen release within the tumor. Additional cell 
targeting properties can be acquired by decorating the nanoparticle surface with afﬁ nity 
ligands or cell penetrating peptides. 52 
 11.6  Conclusion 
 Most of the organic dyes that are currently employed in colourimetric and biosensing 
assays have been around for many decades and although they do not always have optimal 
performance properties they remain useful because they have low toxicity and relatively 
low cost. The emergence of new technologies in frontier industries like biomedicine, 
materials science, and nanotechnology creates a growing demand for dyes that have 
improved performance. One of the major attractions of molecular encapsulation is that it 
uses established, familiar dyes as central chromophores; however, a potential drawback 
with some applications is that the encapsulation matrix will add considerable size and 
mass to the ﬁ nal product. In most cases, the crucial factor that will determine the eventual 
scientiﬁ c and societal impact of encapsulated dye products is the economic cost of 
fabrication, and there is a continuing need to develop high - yielding templated synthesis 
methods. The remarkable synthetic success that has been achieved in recent years is 
reason to expect further major progress. Intellectually, dye encapsulation is likely to 
expand as an interdisciplinary ﬁ eld, connecting fundamental scientists and engineers who 
aim to invent next - generation nanoscale devices and molecular machines.
