 The cyclodextrin ring does not have a well - deﬁ ned depth, so we adopted a simple 
procedure to turn it from an open tube into a cup. We attached some ﬂ exible groups on 
the primary carbons of the cyclodextrin that could partially invade the cavity and produce 
a ﬂ exible ﬂ oor. 21   Later we studied acylation reactions with cyclodextrins that had been 
modiﬁ ed to include a ﬂ oor on the bottom of the cavity  –  and also with improved substrates 
and a somewhat better solvent  – that led to a relative rate of 750,000 compared with the 
uncatalysed hydrolysis rate at the same pH.  22   When we looked at related compounds in 
which we had frozen out one of the degrees of freedom of the substrate the improvement 
came up to a 3,200,000 - fold acceleration compared with the hydrolysis rate in water, and 
with some selectivity among the geometries of the complex. 23 
 In a later study on the optimization of metallocene substrates for such cyclodextrin 
reactions we saw that the two different enantiomers ( 6 ) of a fused ring system  –  in which 
there was no substrate ﬂ exibility  –  was 62 - fold faster for one enantiomer than the other 
and showed a rate 150 million times as fast for acylation as was the rate of hydrolysis in 
water at the same pH.  24   We then addressed this with molecular modeling calculations, 
and saw that quantitative theory accounted well for these ﬁ ndings. 25

 When the leaving group on these esters was less reactive than  p - nitrophenoxide, we 
and Menger had seen that the rate acceleration decreased strongly.  26,27 We reasoned that 
a completely rigid substrate has a problem if the rate - determining step involves forward 
decomposition of the tetrahedral intermediate, since it is necessary for the ester carbonyl 
to rotate in the ﬁ nal product. This explained why reactions whose rate - determining step 
involved the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate were very fast, while those in which 
forward decomposition of the intermediate to the product was rate determining were not 
nearly so well accelerated. We solved this problem by putting in one degree of rotational 
freedom in the substrate, which permitted the needed rotation, and saw that now there 
was no abnormal behaviour of the  p - nitrophenoxide group. 26 
 In a different experimental approach to the question of geometric changes during the 
acylation reaction of cyclodextrin bound substrates, we collaborated with Le Noble in a 
study of pressure effects on the reaction rates. 28   The volume changes that this technique 
indicated  –  as starting materials proceeded to the transition state  –  were consistent with

the conclusions we had reached from earlier studies of rate dependences on substrate 
geometries.  
 2.3  Catalytic Reactions in Cyclodextrin Cavities: Aromatic Substitution 
 In the previous reactions the cyclodextrin acted as a reactant, not a catalyst. However, 
there are some excellent examples in which true catalysis occurs with simple binding into 
a cyclodextrin cavity. Here we will describe the cases where the cyclodextrin has not 
been modiﬁ ed, while in later sections we will discuss cases in which additional catalytic 
groups have been added to the cyclodextrin, and mimics of metalloenzymes and of 
enzymes with co - enzymes have been achieved. 
 In our earlier study we saw that we could achieve geometric selectivity in the chlorina-
tion of anisole by HOCl in water solution.  29   In simple water solution we saw a 1.5 ratio 
of  para  chlorination to  ortho  chlorination of the anisole, while in a 9   mM concentration 
of  α - cyclodextrin the  para - to  ortho  - ratio was 29.6. Under these conditions the anisole 
was only 72% bound into the cavity, so these results indicated that the cyclodextrin not 
only covered the  ortho  positions, it also actively catalysed the  para chlorination. The 
most reasonable idea about this was that one of the hydroxyl groups of the cyclodextrin 
reacted with HOCl to become a hypochlorite group, and that this then delivered the 
chlorine to the  para position of the bound anisole (Figure  2.2 ). 
 In a subsequent detailed study we saw that the chlorination of unbound anisole involved 
two molecules of HOCl, surely as their very reactive product Cl 2 O, while the chlorination 
in the complex involved only a single molecule of HOCl. The obvious conclusion from 
this is that the HOCl reacts with a hydroxyl group of the cyclodextrin to make a hypochlo-
rite that is able to donate a chlorine atom to the  para  position of bound anisole, which is 
the one accessible when the anisole is fully bound. Proximity makes up for the weak 
chlorinating ability of a hypochlorite. 
 In a full paper we examined this system in more detail.  30   We found that a substituting 
reagent, a diazonium ion that could not be delivered by a cyclodextrin hydroxy, was not 
catalysed by the cyclodextrin, since the diazonium group could not be covalently linked 
to a hydroxyl of the cyclodextrin and still be an electrophile. As another piece of evidence, 
when we looked at  para  - methoxytoluene we saw that binding to the cyclodextrin now 
inhibited chlorination, which of course occurred on the  ortho - chloro position. However, 
with  para - cresol there was again chlorination ortho to the oxygen, but this was now cata-
lysed by the cyclodextrin binding. In this case, in contrast to the methoxytoluene, the 
polar hydroxyl group would be expected to protrude from the cavity, bringing the  ortho 
position within reach of chlorines covalently linked to hydroxyl groups.

Cyclodextrins 
47
 In another paper related to this chemistry we examined   α - cyclodextrin in which all 
of the C - 6 and C - 2 hydroxyl groups were methylated.  31   We found that this was also 
an excellent selective catalyst for the chlorinations, and in particular because anisole 
binds more strongly into this somewhat more hydrophobic cavity we saw that the 
selectivity was even higher, reﬂ ecting a higher proportion of bound substrate. This 
demonstrates that the C - 3 hydroxyl can be the one that delivers the chlorine to the 
substrate, although it does not rule out the possibility of other hydroxyls being involved 
in the case where we do not have them selectively methylated. In the same paper we 
also prepared a polymer of   α - cyclodextrin by cross - linking it with epichlorhydrin. We 
saw that this polymer was an excellent catalyst for the selective chlorination of anisole, 
and when a water solution of anisole and HOCl was simply run down a column con-
taining the polymer the product was essentially completely chlorinated in the  para 
position. 
 One extra point might be mentioned about these catalysts. There is an enzyme, chlo-
rinase, that will also chlorinate anisole but with only the random 60/40 distribution 
between  para  and  ortho  chlorination. The enzyme obviously has not been optimized for 
this process, but it is fair to say that our very simple artiﬁ cial enzyme,   α - cyclodextrin, is 
actually better at selective chlorination of this substrate than the enzyme is. 
 2.3.1  Catalytic Reactions in Cyclodextrin Cavities: Diels – Alder Reactions 
 We also examined Diels – Alder reactions in a cyclodextrin complex.  32   In the reaction of 
cyclopentadiene with 2 - butenone (Figure  2.3 ) or with acrylonitrile we saw that there was 
catalysis in water with  β  - cyclodextrin, but not with   α  - cyclodextrin, which was an inhibi-
tor. The cyclopentadiene bound into both of the cyclodextrins, but only in the   β -
 cyclodextrin is there also room for the dienophile to ﬁ t. In this same publication  32 we saw 
that the Diels – Alder reaction is also strongly accelerated simply in water solution, which 
favours the transition state for the reaction in which a smaller total amount of hydrophobic 
surface is exposed to the water solvent. This latter ﬁ nding stimulated us, and others, to 
study many other examples of catalytic effects in water alone with hydrophobic reagents. 
However, the cyclodextrin effect was added on top of this in the case where both reagents 
could ﬁ t into the pocket. 
 2.4  Other Solvents than Water 
 In a later study we examined Diels – Alder reactions in non - aqueous polar solvents, both 
in the solvents alone and in the solvents with   β - cyclodextrin. 33 We found that DMSO did 
not promote   β  - cyclodextrin binding, but that it was promoted by both ethylene glycol and

formamide. Thus the  ‘ hydrophobic ’  binding induced by water can be duplicated to a lesser 
extent with these other water - like solvents. 
 In a previous study on simple cyclodextrin binding we examined the ability of cyclo-
dextrin to bind various substrates in dimethyl sulfoxide solution rather than in water.  19 
We saw that indeed hydrophobic substances were bound into the cyclodextrin, and also 
that DMSO itself was a solvent in which the acylation of a cyclodextrin hydroxyl group 
by a bound ester could be observed. Cyclodextrin binding is not exclusively limited to 
water solutions, as had been suggested by others previously, but water is so far the best 
solvent to see such binding and catalytic processes. 
 2.5  Catalytic Reactions Produced by Cyclodextrins With Covalently 
Attached Catalytic Groups 
 2.5.1  Catalysed Hydrolysis Reactions 
 Combining a cyclodextrin for substrate binding with catalysis of a reaction by some 
attached groups seems to be the best approach so far for the production of artiﬁ cial 
enzymes that imitate the situation in natural enzymes, where binding and catalysis nor-
mally involve different enzyme groups. Catalytic groups can be attached to either the 
primary or the secondary face of a cyclodextrin, and on the secondary face there are both 
carbon - 2 and carbon - 3 positions to which attachment can be made. We synthesized some 
 β - cyclodextrin compounds carrying phosphate groups at the carbon - 2, carbon - 3, or 
carbon - 6 positions and compared their effectiveness as general acids or as general base 
catalysts with bound substrates.  34 All were to some extent catalytic. 
 The ﬁ rst compound described as an  ‘ artiﬁ cial enzyme ’  in the literature was the one we 
reported in which we attached a metal ion binding group to   α - cyclodextrin. 35 We found 
that this would bind  p  - nitrophenyl acetate into the cavity and a bound nickel ion then 
catalysed the hydrolysis of the substrate. This was a direct hydrolysis, not an acylation 
of a cyclodextrin hydroxyl (which is not in reach with the  para  esters). This type of cata-
lyst then extends metal - catalysed reactions to substrates that do not intrinsically bind to 
metal ions, which was formerly required for such catalysis. 
 Even better rates of hydrolysis were seen when a cyclodextrin dimer was used in which 
the linking group had a metal ion bound in a position to be able to catalyse hydrolysis of 
an appropriate substrate. In our ﬁ rst example (Figure  2.4 ) we showed that a dipeptide 
could bind across such a metal binding linker, and that its afﬁ nity for binding was 
increased when the linker carried a zinc ion that could coordinate to the peptide group.  36 
However, this was not powerful enough to catalyse the cleavage of the peptide. With

esters involving two hydrophobic groups we saw outstanding acceleration of catalysis, 
with acceleration 220,000 - fold faster than the simple rate of uncatalysed hydrolysis under 
the same conditions. This was comparable to the rate acceleration seen at the time by the 
best catalytic antibodies. 
 Interestingly, in a study of the binding of ditopic substrates to such cyclodextrin dimers 
we saw that the binding was dominated by an improved enthalpy, rather than entropy.  37 
The simplest ideas about chelate binding would have suggested an entropy advantage, 
but in solution enthalpy – entropy compensation can be seen if the binding or release of 
water molecules is also considered. 
 In a later study we examined the ability of cyclodextrin dimers linked by a bipyridyl 
unit to catalyse the hydrolysis of a phosphate ester,  bis - p - nitrophenyl phosphate. 38 With 
a bound lanthanum ion the hydrolysis was accelerated by 300 million - fold, a huge accel-
eration that could well be of practical interest in the hydrolysis of phosphate esters gener-
ally. A full paper described this work in some detail. 39 
 In earlier work we had demonstrated that a zinc complex of pyridyl - 2 - carboxaldoxime 
( 7 ) could be effective in cleaving esters. The interesting point is that the oxime anion is 
available as a nucleophile and the zinc as an electrophile, but they are not coordinated to 
each other  –  which would of course destroy the catalytic effect. To amplify catalysis we 
attached such oxime - zinc complexes to   β - cyclodextrin on both the secondary and primary 
faces of the cyclodextrin and examined their reaction with  p - nitrophenyl acetate. 40 We 
observed burst kinetics, in which there was an extremely rapid release of one mole of 
nitrophenoxide ion, followed by a slower release in a second phase. This indicated that 
we ﬁ rst rapidly produced the acetate of the oxime, and this then slowly hydrolysed to 
regenerate the oxime anion for further catalytic reaction. Such burst kinetics is very com-
monly seen in enzymatic reactions of  para - nitrophenyl acetate, reﬂ ecting the same kind 
of two - step overall mechanism.

 One problem with such studies is that  p  - nitrophenyl acetate is a highly reactive ester, 
and it is more of a challenge to catalyse the hydrolysis of ordinary esters or of amides. 
In a move in this direction we showed that an appropriate cyclodextrin dimer with a bound 
copper ion ( 8 ) could indeed catalyse the hydrolysis of an ordinary ester group, not a 
phenyl ester. 41 The acceleration was 18,000 - fold, certainly a respectable catalytic result. 
 2.5.2  Ribonuclease Mimics 
 The class of enzymes known as ribonucleases catalyses two separate reactions (Figure 
 2.5 ). In the ﬁ rst one a phosphate diester between two RNA units is cleaved by attack of 
the C - 2 hydroxyl to convert the species into a cyclic phosphate with release of the other 
RNA unit, so the chain is cleaved. In a second reaction ribonuclease catalyses the conver-
sion of the cyclic phosphate back to an open - chain phosphate monoester. In both reactions

ribonuclease A uses two catalytic groups  –  the imidazoles of histidine 12 and histidine 119 
 –  using one as a base catalyst and the other, in its protonated form, as an acid catalyst.   
 In the cyclization - cleavage, histidine - 12 is the base that removes the proton from the 
C - 2 hydroxyl group of ribose and histidine - 119 is the acid group that eventually proto-
nates the leaving oxygen of the second nucleoside. In the hydrolysis of the cyclic phos-
phate these roles are reversed, with the now deprotonated histidine - 119 acting as a base 
to deliver a water molecule while the protonated histidine - 12 now acts to protonate the 
leaving C - 2 oxygen that had originally attacked in the formation of the cyclic phosphate. 
This reversal of roles explains why the cyclic phosphate is not cleaved as rapidly by the 
enzyme as would normally be required for a reactive intermediate. The cyclic phosphate 
presented to the enzyme in its starting protonation state would not have the acid and base 
groups in the right position for the second cleavage step. In a sense this is almost a see -
 saw mechanism, in which ﬁ rst a base and acid combination produces cyclic phosphate 
and then the resulting new base and acid combination catalyses the second step. 
 The cleavage of the cyclic phosphate is particularly interesting because it is relatively 
well deﬁ ned in geometry, compared to the somewhat ﬂ exible phosphate diester group. 
For this reason we undertook a study of catalysed hydrolysis of a rigid cyclic phosphate, 
a mimic of that formed with RNA itself. In our initial study we used the cyclic phosphate 
of  t - butyl - catechol ( 9 ) as the substrate, and cyclodextrins carrying two attached imidazole 
rings as catalysts.  42   Tabushi reported the preparation of compound in which   β - cyclodextrin 
was converted to a disulfonate derivative on the primary side.  43   We have used this com-
pound to make a cyclodextrin  bis - imidazole ( 10 ) by simple displacement with imidazole, 
and used it as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of the catechol cyclic phosphate  9 . All of our 
evidence indicated that this disulfonation was not speciﬁ c, so  10  was a mixture of what 
we call the AB and AC  bis - imidazoles, in which the glucose rings of   β - cyclodextrin are 
lettered sequentially from A through G.

 We saw that this  bis  - imidazole mixture was a powerful catalyst for the hydrolysis of 
the cyclic phosphate, showing two exciting new aspects. First of all it was in fact a 
bifunctional catalyst whose plot of pH  vs.  rate was a bell - shaped curve, just as with the 
natural enzyme ribonuclease itself. Furthermore, it was a much better catalyst than cyclo-
dextrin mono - imidazole, obtained from simple cyclodextrin tosylate. In addition, the 
reaction was highly speciﬁ c with respect to the product, cleaving the cyclic phosphate so 
as to leave the phosphate on oxygen 3 and the new 4 - hydroxy group  para  to the  t - butyl 
group in  11 . This is the selectivity expected if the imidazole is able to deliver a water 
molecule to the cyclic phosphate in a line more or less perpendicular to the rotational axis 
of the cyclodextrin, as models suggested. In this hydrolysis the two imidazoles are playing 
the same role as they do in the enzyme, with the basic imidazole delivering the water 
molecule to the phosphate by acting as a general base to remove the proton while the 
imidazolium ion acts to furnish a proton for the cleavage (Figure  2.6 ). 
 At the time we assumed that this used the mechanism commonly proposed for such 
processes, in which the proton was simply delivered to the leaving group. However, other 
work, to be described shortly, indicated that the mechanism of this cleavage is more 
interesting than this simple idea suggests. In a subsequent study we examined a cyclo-
dextrin  bis  - imidazole in which the imidazole rings were held further from the cyclodextrin 
through a sulfur - carbon bridge.  44   In this case the water was delivered in a somewhat dif-
ferent direction, and now the cleavage of the cyclic phosphate involved a preferential 
formation of the monophosphate with the phosphorus on the  para  oxygen while the meta 
oxygen was present as the free hydroxyl group. In this paper we also indicated that the 
imidazolium ion could be coordinated to one of the phosphate oxygens rather than simply 
delivering a proton to the leaving group, a bit of foresight that was eventually proven to 
be correct. 
 A striking result was observed when we synthesized a new isomer of the cyclodextrin 
 bis  - imidazole, one in which the imidazole groups were attached to the primary carbons 
of two neighboring glucose units, the so - called AB isomer.  45   By the ordinary mechanism 
 –  in which a water is delivered by a general base imidazole to the phosphorus as the 
imidazolium ion of the second catalyst protonates the leaving group  – this isomer should 
have been essentially inactive, since the 180 degree requirement for the previous mecha-
nism is impossible with these two neighboring imidazoles. However, this turned out to

be the most potent of all three  bis  - imidazoles (we had in the meantime learned to prepare 
both the AC and AD isomers as pure materials, not as a mixture). 
 The observation that the AB isomer of cyclodextrin bisimidazole is the most potent 
catalyst requires a new mechanism (Figure  2.7 ). The imidazolium cation is putting the 
proton on a phosphate oxygen anion instead of on the leaving group, so the two protons 
that are moving need to be much closer, more or less 90 degrees apart rather than 180 
degrees. Such a mechanism requires that the cleavage be a two - step process in which the 
ﬁ rst step involves the addition of water to the phosphate to make a ﬁ ve - coordinate phos-
phorus, a phosphorane anion. In a second step this anion has to cleave to liberate the free 
ribose hydroxyl group with assistance by an imidazolium cation. 
 This mechanism is really unambiguous for the model system, so we were interested to 
see whether we could ﬁ nd any evidence for it as well in the cleavage of RNA by imidazole 
buffers. In work that we will not describe further in this review, since it does not involve 
cyclodextrin chemistry, we were indeed able to get convincing evidence that imidazole 
buffers cleave the simple dinucleotide uridyluridine through such a phosphorane interme-
diate rather than by direct cleavage.  46   We also proposed that this might well be preferred 
by the enzyme itself, and offered some arguments for this, although it is not universally 
accepted as the mechanism for the enzyme. 
 We had invoked a simultaneous two proton transfer mechanism rather than a sequential 
mechanism  –  in which one catalytic group followed the other in the overall process  – and 
were able to test this with a technique called proton inventory.  47   We examined the original 
cyclodextrin  bis  - imidazole in mixtures of water and D 2 O and saw that the rate constant 
as a function of deuterium concentration followed a curved line, indicating that the isotope 
effect involved two different protons rather than a single one. To validate this, we also 
examined the same kind of plot with the cyclodextrin mono - imidazole, in which only one 
proton would be expected to be moving in the transition state, and this indeed followed 
a linear plot supporting a single proton motion in the isotope effect. 
 Some of this work is described in reviews that include the cyclodextrin work.  48 – 51 We 
also examined a comparison of catalysts with the AB placement of imidazoles but based 
on either   α - cyclodextrin,  β - cyclodextrin or   γ  - cyclodextrin. And these were also compared 
with substrates carrying various groups other than  t  - butyl. The conclusion from this work 
was that by far the best rates and selectivities were seen in cases where there was a very

tight ﬁ t between substrate and catalyst cyclodextrin ring, giving the best deﬁ nition of the 
geometry of the system and resulting in the highest rate constant. 52 
 Some years ago we had studied the cleavage of the simple nucleotide uridyluridine by 
a combination of imidazole buffer and zinc ion. We found that they were very effective 
cooperative catalysts for the process, much more effective that simple imidazole buffer 
alone. 53   Thus we prepared a bifunctional catalyst based on   β - cyclodextrin in which we 
attached one imidazole ring and one metal ligand group, and saw that they were effective 
catalysts for the cleavage of the  t - butylcatechol cyclic phosphate. 54   This is a model for 
the many metalloenzymes containing not only a metal ion but also a basic group as part 
of the catalytic centre. In this paper we reported that the combination of a zinc ion chelate 
and an imidazole were more effective than simple imidazole buffer in cyclizing a model 
for RNA and then cleaving it. This is an attractive lead for the synthesis of a related 
cyclodextrin compound, which has not yet been studied. 
 2.6  Binding by Cyclodextrins and their Dimers and Trimers 
 We saw very strong binding of lithocholic acid to   β - cyclodextrin. 55 The AB  cis geometry 
in this substrate made it ﬁ t particularly well into the cyclodextrin cavity. This study was 
related to the studies on steroid oxidations that we will describe later. We took up a study 
of the binding by cyclodextrin dimers.  56   With various linkers between the cyclodextrins, 
which were attached on both the primary and the secondary faces, we saw cooperative 
very strong binding of a number of substrates with two groups that could bind into a 
cyclodextrin cavity. Interestingly, cholesterol as a substrate is large enough to be able to 
bridge into the two rings of some cyclodextrin dimers.  57   We saw evidence for such binding 
in both well - deﬁ ned cyclodextrin dimers and also in cyclodextrin polymers in which there 
were of course dimeric sections that could encompass both ends of the cholesterol in 
binding. 
 Even more strikingly, when we linked two cyclodextrins with a pair of linkers attached 
to the A and B glucose residues we saw two dimers that had very different binding prop-
erties (Figure  2.8 ). 58   When the linkage was from the A residue of one to the B residue of 
the other the result was a structure we described as the  ‘ clamshell ’ , in which it was pos-
sible for a substrate to bind simultaneously into the two rings. When the linkage was from 
the A residue of one cyclodextrin to the A residue of the other, and B to B, the result was 
that we had a structure we described as a  ‘ loveseat ’  in which no substrate could occupy 
both cyclodextrins at the same time because the linkers interfered with such binding. We

also described the clamshell version as  ‘ occlusive ’  while the loveseat was described as 
 ‘ aversive ’ . The aversive isomer showed normal binding of substrates with two binding 
ends, with no cooperative binding of both ends into the dimer. On the other hand the 
occlusive isomer had a binding constant as high as 10 10  M  − 1 . This corresponded to a free 
energy larger than additive, as expected for chelate binding.   
 We have found that what we called  ‘ antihydrophobic ’ agents could increase the solu-
bilities of hydrocarbon groups in water and would also decrease their ability to bind into 
cyclodextrin. In a quantitative study we saw that the free energies corresponding to these 
two processes were the same, indicating that the decreased binding principally resulted 
from effects on the substrate, not on the cyclodextrin.  59   We also examined these effects 
on the binding of cyclodextrin dimers. As described earlier,  60   we have looked at cyclo-
dextrin dimers with catalytic groups in the linker as catalysts for hydrolysis processes. A 
full paper summarized some of the results of these binding studies.  61 
 We also examined the synthesis and binding properties of some cyclodextrin trimers.  62 
With substrates that might be able to occupy all three of the binding cavities we did see 
improved binding compared with that for cyclodextrin dimers, but not by as large a factor 
as one might have expected. It seems likely that we have not yet achieved the correct 
non - ﬂ exible geometry in the case of the trimers. I will describe another example of 
binding to a cyclodextrin trimer in the section on mimics of cytochrome P - 450 enzymes. 
 We have examined some of possible applications of the strong binding by cyclodextrin 
dimers. In one study we examined the use of cyclodextrin dimers with a light - cleavable 
link as a possible carrier for the photosensitizer in photodynamic tumor therapy.  63,64 The 
idea, which was demonstrated, is that irradiating the complex would cause singlet oxygen 
to cleave the linker, whereupon the substrate would be released from the dimer since it 
did not have the advantage of chelate binding. If this occurred at the tumor site, because 
irradiation was directed there, this could lead to concentration of the photodynamic mate-
rial right next to the tumor. This should avoid the problem that photodynamic processes 
can otherwise occur throughout the body, usually with unpleasant or toxic effects. 
 We also examined the binding of various peptides to   β - cyclodextrin. Simple   β -
 cyclodextrin itself showed selective binding of particular dipeptides, reﬂ ecting the 
sequence of hydrophobic side chains.  65   Protein aggregation in solution normally involves 
the binding to each other of hydrophobic surfaces in the protein monomers, so cyclodex-
trin binding might well be expected to disrupt this. In one study we saw that indeed 
cyclodextrin dimers could disrupt protein aggregation, a ﬁ nding that could lead to selec-
tively useful processes.  66   In a cooperative study we saw that some of our dimers and even 
trimers acted as inhibitors of amyloid peptide aggregation, the process that is damaging 
in Alzheimer ’ s disease. 67 
 Helical structures are important in proteins, and the extent of helix formation in a given 
polypeptide can be inﬂ uenced by external factors. In a study related to this question we 
saw that with appropriate cyclodextrin dimers we could induce helix formation in some 
oligopeptides if the helix structure presented hydrophobic side chains in a geometry such 
that our dimer could bind to them, stabilizing the helix. 68

 Transaminase enzymes react pyridoxamine phosphate with ketoacids to form pyridoxal 
phosphate and amino acids (Figure  2.9 ). This is the ﬁ rst step in an overall transamination

process in which the pyridoxal phosphate is then converted back to pyridoxamine phos-
phate by the sacriﬁ ce of a different amino acid, which is converted to its ketoacid. We 
have imitated the ﬁ rst part of this process, the conversion of pyridoxamine to pyridoxal 
while making a ketoacid into an amino acid, and studied how we could promote this 
process with the help of binding to cyclodextrins. In later work we have shown how 
some polyamine substances can also catalyse such a process, and can as well catalyse a 
reverse process in which the pyridoxamine is regenerated, so the overall process is in 
fact catalytic. We will describe this regeneration of pyridoxamine at the end of this 
section. 
 In our ﬁ rst study we attached a pyridoxamine unit to a primary carbon of   β - cyclodextrin 
(structure  12 ). 69   We saw that pyridoxamine alone is able to transaminate pyruvic acid to 
form alanine, phenylpyruvic acid to form phenylalanine, and indolepyruvic acid to form 
tryptophan, all with equal reactivity by competition experiments. However, when the 
cyclodextrin was attached to the pyridoxamine there was a 200 - fold preference for the 
indolepyruvate over pyruvate in one - to - one competition, forming greater than 98% of 
tryptophan, and in the competition with phenylpyruvate and pyruvate the phenylalanine 
was formed in greater than 98% as well. Thus the ability of the substrates to bind into 
the cyclodextrin cavity led to striking selectivities. In addition there was some chiral 
induction in these processes, since   β  - cyclodextrin is itself chiral, but the magnitudes of 
the induction were quite modest.

 We devised a method to perform the selective tosylation of the C - 2 hydroxyl group in 
 β - cyclodextrin, 70   and used it to attach the pyridoxamine to this secondary side of the 
cyclodextrin. 71   Again we saw some preference for transamination of the aromatic ketoac-
ids, but by less than we had observed with the pyridoxamine attached to C - 6. The tryp-
tophan synthesis was only 25 times as fast as that for alanine, while the phenylalanine 
formation was 18 times as fast as alanine in competitive reactions. Modest enantioselec-
tivities were observed as well with this C - 2 linked pyridoxamine, and they differed in 
detail from those produced with the C - 6 isomer that we had reported earlier.

 We also examined an interesting modiﬁ ed version in which the   β - cyclodextrin had a 
pyridoxamine attached to the primary C - 6 carbon but the other six hydroxymethyl groups 
on the primary side were deoxygenated to become methyl groups. This leads to quite a 
different hydrophobic cavity,  72   but it showed properties similar to those of the original 
compound that still had its primary hydroxyls unmodiﬁ ed. 
 In a full paper we described this work in detail, including some work on pyridoxamine 
derivatives that did not involve cyclodextrins and other work in which a synthetic binding 
group was used instead of the cyclodextrin.  73 
 We also set about to see whether we could get good chiral induction in the product 
amino acids, not by the simple accident of the chirality of the cyclodextrin but by basic 
groups that could direct the proton transfer involved in transamination so as to give a 
preference for one enantiomer of the product amino acid. We described some of this 
work, 74   and in it also referred to work reported by Tabushi in which the same general 
principle was applied. In our work only relatively modest selectivities were seen; the 
largest optical ratio (L/D) in the product was only 6.8. 
 In the meantime the Tabushi laboratory had prepared a somewhat different version of 
this idea and had reported outstanding optical ratios. 75   In his paper my name was included 
simply because I had proposed the original idea, but I did not have any interaction with 
the experimental evidence. In our later work we found that attempts to repeat the work 
reported in reference 75 did not lead to the reported results. 
 The pyridoxamine units linked to the cyclodextrins in these previous cases are rather 
ﬂ exibly attached, and do not perhaps have the optimum deﬁ ned geometry. Thus we pre-
pared a new series of compounds in which a pyridoxamine unit carried two sulfurs in a 
well - deﬁ ned geometry so that they could link to the A and B primary carbons of   β -
 cyclodextrin, using the same mechanism by which we had originally made the 6A, 6B 
bisimidazole cyclodextrin. With the new pyridoxamines we observed very high selectivi-
ties for hydrophobic substrates, and excellent control of their detailed geometries. 76 
 In a full paper we described detailed studies of our various approaches to chiral induc-
tion in the amino acid products of transaminations.  77   In that paper we also pointed out 
the odd fact that the Tabushi laboratory had reported the use of large concentrations of 
buffer in their reaction, which would have been expected to interfere with the selective 
proton transfer by an internal catalytic group if the buffer itself could start playing the 
role of protonating catalyst. 
 In our subsequent work we studied compounds in which a pyridoxamine was attached 
to C - 6 of  β - cyclodextrin and an imidazole unit was attached to C - 6 of the neighbouring 
glucose residue.  78   The two isomers are diastereomers, reﬂ ecting the chirality of their 
attachment and the chirality of the glucose units. We found that we could in fact get a 
reversal of the optical induction reﬂ ecting the different geometry of these two enantiom-
ers. Interestingly, we found that the imidazole as placed did not catalyse selective proton 
transfer, but instead performed a selective blocking of one face of the reaction intermedi-
ate so that protonation by the medium occurred on the side away from the imidazole ring. 
It was in this paper that we also reported the re - examination of the Tabushi case and our 
ﬁ nding that his isomers showed little enantioselectivity, unrelated to the position of the 
so - called protonating group. 
 Pyridoxal phosphate is actually a catalyst for a number of transformations of amino 
acids that do not involve transamination. It is the catalyst in amino acid racemases, for

instance, and in some interesting rearrangements of amino acids. Thus we examined a 
pyridoxal unit attached to   β  - cyclodextrin to see whether we could imitate the substrate 
binding and reactions involved in such pyridoxal catalysis. Pyridoxal catalyses the con-
densation of serine with indole to produce tryptophan, by a process in which the imine 
formed between pyridoxal and serine dehydrates to form a double bond to which the 
indole adds. We thought it likely that we could bind the indole into the cyclodextrin cavity 
and have it couple with the species that pyridoxal forms. We found that indeed this catalyst 
could couple d,l -   β  - chloroalanine to indole, in which the imine formed between pyridoxal 
and this alanine derivative eliminated HCl to form the unsaturated intermediate that reacts 
with indole to form tryptophan.  79   The results indicated some cooperativity in the process, 
but it was not very effective. 
 Pyridoxal phosphate is also the catalyst for the process by which glycine and for-
maldehyde are reversibly condensed in an aldol reaction to form serine. In a system 
that did not involve substrate binding with cyclodextrins we were able to show that we 
could duplicate that process, and that with sufﬁ cient geometric control we could obtain 
reasonable optical selectivity.  80   We also examined transamination in which the group 
that bound the substrate was a polyamine with a hydrophobic core, rather than a cyclo-
dextrin. 81  With this system we saw that we could reverse the transamination process 
 –  in the sense of converting the pyridoxal derivate back to pyridoxamine  –  by using a 
sacriﬁ cial  α - methyl amino acid that would undergo irreversible decarboxylation and 
transamination to afford the pyridoxamine and a ketone derived from the original sac-
riﬁ cial amino acid. 82 
 2.7  Mimics of Enzymes that Use Thiamine Pyrophosphate 
as a Co - Enzyme 
 Thiamine pyrophosphate ( 13 ) is the co - factor for a number of enzymes that can be 
described as stabilizing hypothetical acyl anion intermediates. For instance, it is the co -
 enzyme for the enzyme carboxylase that catalyses the conversion of pyruvic acid to 
acetaldehyde. We had early shown that this mechanism involves a thiazolium anion ( 14 ) 
whose second resonance form ( 15 ) is a carbene.  83   Ionization of the C - 2 proton of the thia-
zolium ring generates this species that can add nucleophilically to carbonyl groups such 
as that in pyruvic acid, forming an intermediate whose decarboxylation generates a sta-
bilized anion.

 In early studies of this chemistry we had examined the ability of such thiazolium 
salts to catalyse the benzoin condensation, a process which also formally involves an 
acyl anion but which is really of course the anion in which the thiazolium salt has 
been added to the carbonyl group (Figure  2.10 ). In this sense the thiazolium anion 
is very much like cyanide anion, the normal catalyst for simple benzoin condensa-
tions. Benzaldehyde would be expected to bind into a   β - cyclodextrin cavity, so we 
attached a thiazolium salt to a primary carbon of   β  - cyclodextrin and examined it as 
a catalyst. 84 We found that this was not a better catalyst for the benzoin condensation, 
apparently because there was no room in the   β  - cyclodextrin cavity for the binding 
of two benzaldehyde molecules. However it was clear that at least the reaction inter-
mediate was being formed; we got very rapid tritium exchange from the aldehyde 
by formation of the thiazolium adduct, and as well a very rapid oxidation of  para -
 t  - butyl benzaldehyde by ferricyanide ion since it was able to oxidize the reaction 
intermediate formed when the bound  t  - butyl benzaldehyde underwent addition of the 
thiazolium ring. 
 We then prepared essentially the same compound but based it on   γ - cyclodextrin, the 
molecule with eight glucose residues that has a cavity large enough to hold two ben-
zaldehyde groups.  85   This gave a 7 - fold to 9 - fold acceleration of the formation of benzoin 
relative to a simple thiazolium salt without the attached   γ - cyclodextrin binding group. 
In subsequent work we have shown that in this system the use of the polyamine with 
a hydrophobic core as a catalyst has led to even larger rate accelerations, up to 
2000 - fold.

 2.8  Aldol Condensations Catalysed by Cyclodextrin Derivatives 
 We prepared a series of catalysts with relatively simple groups attached to a cyclodextrin 
that would be able to catalyse an aldol condensation between acetone and some bound 
aromatic aldehydes, when the acetone formed an enamine with a catalytic group such as 
a simple amine.  86   We observed catalyses as high as 270 - fold relative to the uncatalysed 
aldol condensation with some of these cyclodextrin derivatives. 
 We also took advantage of our synthesis of three isomers of   β - cyclodextrin  bis - 
imidazoles  –  those with the imidazoles on neighboring glucose units (AB), with one 
intervening glucose unit (AC) and with two intervening glucoses (AD)  –  to examine the 
detailed geometry involved in the enolization of ketones, in which a proton is removed 
from an  α  carbon by a general base while another proton is added to the carbonyl 
oxygen by a general acid. We examined the rate of exchange of the methyl group of  p -
 t  - butylacetophenone with deuterium in D 2 O catalysed by these three  bis - imidazole isomers 
and by  β - cyclodextrin 6 - monotosylate. 87 
 The best catalyst was the AD isomer, the reverse of what we had seen in our ribonu-
clease model studies. The pH/rate proﬁ le indicated that there was bifunctional catalysis 
by imidazole and imidazolium groups. This indicated that proton removal has a prefer-
ential direction of attack by base that is not directly along the C - H bond line, but instead 
pushes the electrons toward the carbonyl group (Figure  2.11 ). Such subtle information is 
available only because of the deﬁ ned geometry in molecular complexes of cyclodextrin 
 bis - imidazoles.

 Subsequently we used the   β - cyclodextrin  bis  - imidazoles to perform aldol condensa-
tions. In our ﬁ rst such study we examined the aldol condensation of ketoaldehyde  16 . 88 
We saw that the best catalyst for this process was again the AD isomer of the  bis - 
imidazole, but there were some special features. First of all, the catalyst promoted deu-
terium exchange into the CH 2  next to the ketone group, so enolization was reversible and 
the addition of this enol to the aldehyde group was rate determining. Thus the bifunctional 
catalyst not only speeded the enolization to the point at which it was reversible and not 
rate - determining, it also catalysed the addition of the enol to the aldehyde group. 
Furthermore, the catalyst reversed the selectivity of enolization, promoting enolization 
next to the accessible keto group even more rapidly than next to the normally more reac-
tive aldehyde group. 
 We also examined aldol condensations of the dialdehyde  17 . 89 Without the special 
catalysis afforded by the cyclodextrin  bis - imidazoles there was an almost random reaction 
to form compounds  18  and  19 , as either aldehyde acted as the enolizing group. However, 
the cyclodextrin imidazole catalysts directed the selective formation of products  19 , with 
no selectivity among its stereoisomers. Interestingly, the least selective catalyst for  17 
was the cyclodextrin mono - imidazole, the AD isomer of the  bis - imidazole was more 
selective, and the most selective was the AB isomer. Obviously these results indicate that 
the cyclodextrin imidazole catalysts promote enolization of the aldehyde group closest to 
the cyclodextrin, as expected, but the subtlety of preferences among the  bis - imidazole 
isomers is not yet understood in this case.

 2.9  Mimics of Enzymes Using Coenzyme B 12 as a Cofactor 
 Coenzyme B 12 is involved in some remarkable catalytic processes, including in particular 
the reversible conversion of a succinic acid derivative to a methylmalonyl derivative 
and the reversible conversion of   β  - methylaspartic acid to glutamic acid. In these reac-
tions vitamin B 12  is covalently linked at its cobalt atom with an adenosine group, and 
the catalytic chemistry involves dissociation of the carbon - cobalt bond and subsequent 
reactions promoted by the resulting adenosyl radical. In our ﬁ rst study we synthesized 
a compound ( 20 ) in which the cobalt of B 12  is covalently linked to one of the primary 
methylene groups of cyclodextrin.  90   We saw that the carbon - cobalt bond easily dissoci-
ated to form a cyclodextrinyl radical. This could then form a substrate radical by group 
transfer from a substrate bound in the cyclodextrin cavity, although not yet by hydrogen 
transfer. 
 
20
Co(B12)
 
 In a subsequent paper we linked B 12  to the cyclodextrin not with a carbon – cobalt bond 
but with a bond to one of the B 12  side chains.  91   We examined the rearrangement and reac-
tion of a substrate that could bind into the cyclodextrin cavity, and for which the B 12 
component could initiate a free radical process with a rearrangement related to those one 
sees in the biochemical processes. Some such preference was seen for the binding sub-
strate compared to the non - binding substrate, indicating that this was a promising begin-
ning to an interesting approach to B 12 mimics. 
 2.10  Mimics of Cytochrome P - 450 
 Cytochrome P - 450 describes a group of enzymes that use a heme group to perform oxida-
tions, including in particular oxidations of carbon - hydrogen bonds. Many model systems 
had been examined for such processes, but they had not included any deﬁ ned binding of 
a substrate in such a way as to achieve pre - selected functionalization of particular carbon 
atoms. Thus we initiated a series of studies of such systems in which we used cyclodex-
trins as binding groups for the substrates to hold them, in water, in such a position as to 
achieve selective functionalizations. 
 In general we used steroids as the substrates. They are rigid and make it easier to 
achieve selectivity without concern about the substrate conformation, and the selective 
oxidation of steroids in particular positions is actually of practical interest. Currently there 
are steroid hormones that are produced by biochemical oxidation using the enzymes 
P - 450, but we wished to produce mimics that would not have the disadvantage of enzy-
matic reactions  –  with their problems in dealing with proteins and fermentation.

Cytochrome P - 450 models are generally used to insert an oxygen atom into either a double 
bond or a carbon - hydrogen bond, although we also demonstrated that such a model could 
insert nitrogen atoms instead, producing interesting and selective ways of synthesizing 
quite useful compounds.  92   We also showed that such nitrogen insertion can be done by 
the actual biological enzyme itself under some conditions.  93 
 We synthesized metalloporphyrins ( 21 ) carrying four   β - cyclodextrin rings attached to 
phenyl groups on the meso carbons of the porphyrin, and examined their use for selective 
oxidations. In our ﬁ rst work we used this system, as its manganese complex, to insert 
oxygens into double bonds of substrate that could doubly bind to cyclodextrins across the 
center of the porphyrin ring.  94   We saw quite good selectivity. As oxidant we use iodoso-
benzene as an oxygen transfer species, putting the oxygen on the manganese which then 
transferred it to the substrate. We also added a coordinating bulky carboxylic acid to the 
system so that it would bind to one face of the manganese, and direct both the substrate 
and the oxygen to the other face.

 We then used this same manganese porphyrin system carrying four   β - cyclodextrins to 
perform the hydroxylation of a saturated carbon in a steroid substrate.  95,96 The steroid ( 22 ) 
had binding groups attached to positions 3 and 17 in rings A and D, so it could dissolve 
in water and use these binding groups to insert into cyclodextrins on opposite sides of 
the porphyrin system. The catalyst was remarkably selective, inserting oxygen only into 
C - 6 of the steroid to make a steroidal alcohol ( 23 ). Furthermore, this alcohol was not 
further oxidized to a carbonyl group, which would normally be an easier oxidation than 
the insertion into a C – H bond. However, molecular models indicated that we could insert 
into the   α  - face of the steroid generating the   α  C - 6 alcohol, but that we could not reach 
the axial  β  - hydrogen on that carbon. Apparently the oxidation of such alcohols to ketones 
by this oxidation class occurs by hydrogen abstraction from the carbinol carbon, and that 
is geometrically impossible in this case.

 One problem with our system was that the catalyst itself was oxidized fairly easily, so 
we did not get many catalytic turnovers. Others working on cytochrome models had 
shown that the catalyst was much more oxidatively stable when the phenyl rings were 
perﬂ uorinated. Thus we synthesized a perﬂ uorinated version ( 24 ) of our previous com-
pound, easily prepared from the porphyrin with four pentaﬂ uorophenyl groups by simple 
reaction with   β - cyclodextrin 6 - thiol, which selectively replaced the  para ﬂ uorines in the 
phenyl rings.  97   While with the previous catalyst we only achieved three to ﬁ ve turnovers 
before the catalyst was destroyed, the new ﬂ uorinated catalyst performed the same selec-
tive hydroxylation of C - 6 in the steroid with 187 turnovers.

 The selective hydroxylation at C - 6 of an androstane ring was striking, but not neces-
sarily the most desired target. We really wanted to functionalize either C - 9 or C - 11 in 
order to be able to convert a simple steroid to a corticosteroid, a process that is currently 
performed by biological fermentation. Models indicated that if we could get triple binding 
of a steroid derivative with binding groups at carbons 3, 6 and 17, the hydrogen on carbon 
9 would be in reach of the oxygen atom on the manganese, so we examined this system.

We synthesized the substrate ( 25 ) using the C - 6 hydroxyl group that we had previously 
inserted, and performed its oxidation with our ﬂ uorinated catalyst. Indeed we saw that 
the result was the product  26  with the selective hydroxylation of C - 9  –  in line with 
molecular models indicating that the preferred geometry of the catalyst/substrate complex 
put the hydrogen at C - 9 in van der Waals contact with the oxygen on the manganese 
atom. 98   We described these studies in more detail and indicated that in some cases as 
many as 3,000 catalytic turnovers were achieved. 99

 Models suggested that we could achieve the desired hydroxylation at C - 9 using only 
two binding groups at carbons 3 and 6 of the steroid, but when this was tried with our 
original catalyst we saw that we obtained not only hydroxylation at C - 9 but also some 
hydroxylation at C - 15. This indicated that we had to adjust the geometry of the complex 
a bit by using a related molecule in which the cyclodextrins were attached to the meta 
positions of the phenyls in the porphyrin, not the  para  positions. To achieve the same 
geometry with an easier synthesis we prepared the porphyrin carrying tetraﬂ uoropyridine 
rings instead of phenyl rings. The cyclodextrins were then attached by substitution next 
to the nitrogen of the pyridine ring, achieving the desired geometry. We found that with 
new catalyst  27  we were able to achieve selective hydroxylation of C - 9 starting with 
oxygens only at C - 3 and C - 6 of the steroid in a doubly bound  –  not triply bound  – 
complex. 100   The entire system was described further in a full paper summarizing the work 
with iodosobenzene as an oxidant and porphyrins carrying four   β - cyclodextrin units as 
the catalyst. 101

oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or potassium persulfate. Such oxidants had been used 
previously in oxidations by metalloporphyrins, but not in an aqueous system. However 
we needed the water system both because we were interested in mimicking such aqueous 
chemistry and also because we needed the hydrophobic binding of the substrates into the 
catalyst cyclodextrin units. In the actual enzyme there is a thiol ligand coordinated to the 
iron in the porphyrin ring, and other work suggested that a thiol ligand as the thiolate 
anion made the porphyrin system a stronger reducing agent able to accept oxygen from 
simpler oxygen donor species. Thus we synthesized a system in which we coordinated a 
phenylthiolate anion to the manganese of the porphyrin and saw that we were able to use 
hydrogen peroxide as the effective oxidant in our water system.  102   We did this in two 
ways. 
 In one approach we synthesized a compound with a covalently linked bridge across 
the porphyrin carrying the phenyl thiol group, and with two cyclodextrins on the other 
two positions. In the other approach we synthesized a phenylthiol derivative with two 
linkers to binding groups, and used it with our original ﬂ uorinated porphyrin. It bound to 
two cyclodextrins on one face of the porphyrin, while the substrate bound to the other 
two cyclodextrins. This is much like the enzyme in which the thiol comes from a cysteine 
of the protein, not from a covalent link to the porphyrin. In both cases we saw that we 
could now use hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant for our selective C - 6 hydroxylation. 
Thus a major problem in the previous work  –  the use of an expensive oxidant  – was 
solved.

Cyclodextrins as Molecular Reactors

 3.1  Introduction 
 Cyclodextrins have been known for more than a century  1   and throughout that time they 
have been the subjects of continuous study, due mainly to their ability to act as molecular 
hosts and form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic guests in aqueous solution (Figure 
 3.1 ). 2   In recent decades these investigations have culminated in numerous applications of 
cyclodextrins in the pharmaceutical industry, as food additives, and in cosmetics and other 
personal care and household products.  3   One theme of our interest in these compounds, 
which is the subject of this chapter, has been their use as molecular reactors. 4 Like the 
other applications, this depends on the formation of inclusion complexes. In this particular 
case, the cyclodextrins are used as miniature reaction vessels and their tendency to form 
inclusion complexes is exploited to manipulate the assembly of reagents in the vessels in 
order to affect the outcomes of chemical transformations at the molecular level. In this 
regard the cyclodextrins are quite similar to the large scale vats and chemical reactors 
used for industrial chemical processing, beakers and ﬂ asks used in laboratory syntheses, 
and pots and saucepans used to prepare food  –  they are simply vessels for chemical reac-
tions. However, the important distinction is that only the molecular containers provide a 
means by which the individual chemical processes may be regulated. Where a variety of

different chemical reactions would take place in bulk media, molecular reactors provide 
a means to favour one or a particular combination. 
 This behaviour is in many ways like that displayed by enzymes and other authors have 
therefore used the term artiﬁ cial enzymes instead of molecular reactors.  5 However, the 
need for a different term has become more important since recent rapid advances in 
molecular biology have provided tools for protein engineering to produce entirely new 
catalysts that might be more obviously classed as artiﬁ cial enzymes, while molecular 
reactors encompass a much broader range of species. Another important distinction is

that while enzymes achieve their effects because they are catalysts and enhance reaction 
rates, molecular reactors frequently bias the balance between various chemical reactions 
to affect the overall outcome by slowing down reactions, but selectively to a greater or 
lesser extent. That is, a molecular reactor may accomplish a particular result either by 
enhancing the rate of a desired process or by decreasing the rate of an undesired one. 
 The molecular reactor concept is common to many parts of this volume, which describe 
a wide variety of such reaction vessels. Many groups other than ours have studied cyclo-
dextrins and other chapters, especially those by Breslow and Takahashi, also deal with 
their application in this context. This chapter is therefore focussed on our particular per-
spective and illustrated mainly with examples from our own laboratories. Much of our 
work has involved modiﬁ ed cyclodextrins 2   because these provide a greater range of 
functional groups and corresponding chemistry, and more opportunities to template reac-
tion geometries, but it would be inappropriate not to acknowledge the related pioneering 
work with the natural cyclodextrins that was carried out by the research groups of 
Cramer, 6 Bender, 7 and others, to provide the essential foundations of this ﬁ eld. 
 3.2  Regiocontrolled Electrophilic Aromatic Substitutions 
 The most straightforward examples of cyclodextrin molecular reactors are probably those 
that involve a change in the regioselectivity of a reaction, as a result of a substrate being 
included in a cyclodextrin in such a way as to restrict or control the geometry of access 
of a reagent. Breslow  et al ., 8,9   in particular have developed this approach to substituting 
hydrogen for functional groups in both aliphatic and aromatic compounds. In an illustra-
tive example we developed,  10   but which is derivative of related aromatic chlorinations,  8,11 
bromination of acetanilide with pyridinium dichlorobromate in water at room temperature 
gave a 56   :   44 ratio of the corresponding  ortho - and  para - substituted monobromides in 
the absence of a cyclodextrin, but that ratio changed to 79  :  21 when   β - cyclodextrin was 
added and, within the limits of detection, only the  para - isomer was produced in the pres-
ence of   α  - cyclodextrin (Figure  3.2 a). It appears that acetanilide includes in the cyclodex-
trins with an orientation that shields the  ortho  - positions, but leaves the  para - position 
exposed to attack by the brominating agent. The beneﬁ t provided by the cyclodextrins in 
the synthesis of  para  - bromoacetanilide is not just to increase the yield, even though with 
 α  - cyclodextrin this is almost doubled. Particularly for reactions carried out on a large 
scale, it is also relevant that less  ortho - substituted by - product is formed, reducing waste 
and simplifying product isolation by obviating fractional crystallisation or chromatogra-
phy. There are several other advantageous features of this system common to many 
involving cyclodextrins: the processes occur in water, which is attractive as an environ-
mentally benign solvent; the cyclodextrins substantially increase the solubility of the 
substrate in water, thereby reducing reaction volumes; and an aqueous solution of the 
cyclodextrin can be reused repeatedly in a batch - type process whereby the substrate and 
reagent are added and, after reaction, the products are separated by extraction, to leave 
the cyclodextrin solution which can be recycled.   
 The effect of the cyclodextrins on the regioselectivity of bromination of anisole is 
similar to that seen with acetanilide (Figure  3.2 b). With systems more activated to elec-
trophilic substitution, such as 3 - methylacetanilide and 3 - methylanisole, the cyclodextrins

also limit the extent of further bromination of the 4 - bromosubstituted initial product 
(Figure  3.2 c). For example, under conditions where treatment of 3 - methylanisole with 
1.1 equivalents of the brominating reagent afforded starting material and the 4 - , 2,4 - , 
4,6 - and 2,4,6 - substituted products in the ratio 23  :  37  :  19  :  20  :  1, addition of   α - cyclodextrin 
changed this ratio to 12  :  46  :  18  :  21  :  1, while in the presence of   β - cyclodextrin only the 
starting material and the 4 - , 2,4 -  and 4,6 - substituted products were detected, in the ratio 
4  :  86  :  5  :  5. Thus   β - cyclodextrin increases the yield of 4 - bromo - 3 - methylanisole from 37 
to 86% and proportionately decreases the amount of by - products from 63 to 14%. 
 The choice of which cyclodextrin is best to use to achieve a particular outcome is 
difﬁ cult to predict. It depends on a number of factors such as the extent of inclusion of 
substrates, reagents and products, that can be calculated from the association constants 
of the various inclusion complexes, but also on the orientation of inclusion and the effect 
of the cyclodextrin on reaction intermediates and the geometry of interactions between 
substrates and reagents, which are not easily determined. Interestingly,   α - cyclodextrin 
was more effective than   β  - cyclodextrin in controlling the bromination of acetanilide and 
anisole, while the opposite was seen with the corresponding reactions of the 3 - methyl -
 substituted substrates. In some cases a more signiﬁ cant effect is achieved with a modiﬁ ed 
cyclodextrin. For example, the bromination of 3 - phenylpropanoic acid gave the  para - and 
 ortho  - monobromides in the ratio 64   :   36 in the absence of a cyclodextrin, and in the ratios 
62  :  38 and 69  :  31 in the presence of   β - and   α  - cyclodextrin, respectively, but using the 
same concentration of the amino cyclodextrin derivative having an amino substituent in 
place of a primary hydroxyl group, only 3 - (4 - bromophenyl)propanoic acid was produced 
(Figure  3.2 d). 12   The substantially greater effect of the modiﬁ ed cyclodextrin in this system 
can be attributed to an ionic interaction between the amino group of the host and the 
carboxyl group of the guest, that are both ionised under the neutral experimental condi-
tions, to stabilise the inclusion complex and control the alignment of the host within the 
guest (Figure  3.2 e). 
 3.3  Catalysis of Hydrolytic Reactions 
 Some of the earliest examples of cyclodextrin molecular reactors involved their use as 
catalysts for hydrolysis of carboxylic acid derivatives, as demonstrated by Bender and 
co - workers 13   with phenyl esters and the natural cyclodextrins, in the original papers in 
this area. The reactions involve transient acylation of the cyclodextrin similar to that seen 
with serine and cysteine proteases. They exhibit kinetic characteristics, such as substrate 
saturation, non - productive binding and competitive inhibition, which are reminiscent of 
enzyme - catalysed processes. In addition, the discrimination displayed by cyclodextrins 
in binding guests and promoting their reactions is analogous to the substrate selectivity 
displayed by enzymes. One form of this type of substrate selectivity displayed by the 
cyclodextrins is chiral discrimination 14 and, for example,   β - cyclodextrin reacts diastere-
oselectively with the ( R ) - enantiomer of the acid chloride of the non - steroidal anti - 
inﬂ ammatory drug Ibuprofen (Figure  3.3 ).  15   The cyclodextrin ester formed through this 
acylation undergoes subsequent hydrolysis to release the drug, and the stereoselectivity 
of the hydrolysis is complementary to that of the acylation, also favouring reaction of the 
diastereomer derived from ( R ) - Ibuprofen. For the combined synthesis and hydrolysis of

Molecular Encapsulation
the cyclodextrin ester, the overall chiral discrimination in favour of the ( R ) - enantiomer 
is a factor of approximately ﬁ fty. 
 With the natural cyclodextrins, hydroxyl groups are the only functionality available to 
promote reactions of included guests. However, the introduction of a diverse range of 
new functional groups through modiﬁ cation of the natural cyclodextrins has resulted in 
catalysts that mimic the entire range of enzyme behaviour. In one particular example, 
Breslow  et al ., 16 constructed a series of bis - imidazole - substituted   β - cyclodextrins that 
catalyse the hydrolysis of 4 - tert - butylcatechol cyclic phosphate. With the 6 A ,6 B -
 disubstituted cyclodextrin, which has imidazole groups in place of the primary hydroxyl 
groups of two adjacent glucopyranose residues, there is good evidence that the reaction 
involves simultaneous bifunctional acid - base catalysis, where one imidazole ring acts as 
a base and the other, which is protonated and therefore present as the imidazolium ion, 
acts as an acid. In this case the controlled alignment of both functional groups and the 
cyclodextrin annulus optimises the geometry for binding and reaction of the included 
substrate. 
 The hydrolysis of organophosphate triesters is a particular challenge that is of interest 
in the remediation of soils and waters contaminated by insecticides of this type, and in 
the destruction of related chemical warfare agents. The natural and most modiﬁ ed cyclo-

dextrins either inhibit or only modestly accelerate breakdown of these phosphates in 
aqueous solution. However, the copper complexes of the   β - cyclodextrin derivatives with 
2 - aminoethylamino and 3 - aminopropylamino groups in place of one of the primary 
hydroxyl substituents efﬁ ciently catalyse the hydrolysis of 4 -  tert - butyl - 2 - nitrophenyl 
dimethyl phosphate at pH 7.0, increasing the rate of reaction of the cyclodextrin - bound 
species by more than 95,000 and 70,000 times, respectively (Figure  3.4 ).  17 The metal-
locyclodextrins are substrate selective and behave as true catalysts, in that there is multiple 
turnover of the triester. The reaction is most probably brought about by metal - bound 
hydroxide. Water bound to copper in the complex of the aminopropylamino - substituted 
cyclodextrin has a p K a of 7.84. 
 3.4  A Molecular Reactor for the Synthesis of Indigoid Dyes 
 In addition to molecular reactors that affect both the regioselectivity of introduction and 
rates of interconversion of functional groups, others have been developed to control the 
outcomes of carbon - carbon bond forming reactions. In this area, one of the systems that 
we have studied in some detail involves the use of a cyclodextrin dimer to template the 
synthesis of indirubin.  18,19   While this dye is of considerable interest in its own right,  18 it 
is most commonly known as a by - product of the formation of indigo, the compound used 
to colour denim. Indirubin has a ruby red colour and the presence of this material in indigo 
or indigo - treated denim results in a pinkish - purple tinge often associated with low quality. 
 Indoxyl, which is readily obtained by hydrolysis of indoxyl acetate, gives indigo 
through oxidative dimerisation, but competitive oxidation of indoxyl affords isatin, that 
also reacts with indoxyl to give indirubin (Figure  3.5 ). To bias these competing processes 
in favour of indirubin production, a dimer comprised of two   β - cyclodextrins joined by 
substituting a primary hydroxyl group of each one with a urea linkage was used as a

template. In principle such a template could have been chosen based on its ability to 
selectively bind the desired product but that was not possible to determine in this case, 
due to the very low solubility of both indirubin and indigo in water. Instead, the cyclo-
dextrin dimer was selected because it showed particularly strong binding of Tropaeolin 
000 No. 2, a water - soluble dye similar in shape to indirubin. The expectation was then 
that since the binding of the Tropaeolin showed the dimer readily adopted the shape of 
indirubin, it would complex both indoxyl and isatin in the orientation to form indirubin 
(Figure  3.6 ), but less readily include two molecules of indoxyl aligned to form indigo. In 
the event, under conditions in which isatin and indoxyl derived from indoxyl acetate 
reacted in the absence of a cyclodextrin to give indigo and indirubin in yields of 16 and 
13%, respectively, the corresponding yields of the dyes formed in the presence of the 
urea - linked cyclodextrin dimer were 0.03 and 1.0% (Table  3.1 ). The cyclodextrin dimer 
changed the ratio of production of the dyes by a factor of more than forty, in favour of 
indirubin.   β - Cyclodextrin and   β  - cyclodextrin dimers joined by oxalamide and succina-
mide groups also reduced the yields of both dyes but did not show the same bias towards 
indirubin formation.     
 The problem with this system is that the molecular reactor offers very little in the way 
of a real practical advantage! The ratio of formation of the dyes has been changed in 
favour of indirubin but only by reducing the overall yield of the two dyes by a factor of 
almost thirty and the yield of indirubin by thirteen times. This is almost certainly the 
result of complexation of indoxyl and isatin by the cyclodextrin, increasing their effective 
steric bulk and reducing the frequency of their productive collisions. At the same time 
the rates of hydrolytic decomposition of indoxyl and isatin are largely unaffected, so these 
processes become more dominant. Similar effects are likely to be common with molecular 
reactors unless complexation increases the desired reactivity in some other way.

 In the present case, this was accomplished with isatin - 5 - sulfonate instead of isatin, 
using the urea - linked cyclodextrin dimer to alter the ratio of formation of indigo, through 
oxidative dimerisation of indoxyl, to indirubin - 5 ′  - sulfonate, from indoxyl and the isatin-
sulfonate (Figure  3.5 ). The isatinsulfonate exists in solution in equilibrium with its 
hydrate, which deprotonates with a p K a  of 9.55 to give the corresponding anion

(Figure  3.7 ). Neither the hydrate nor the anion reacts with indoxyl. Complexation by a 
cyclodextrin decreases the extent of hydration of the isatinsulfonate and increases the p K a 
of the hydrate to above 10.0. For the condensation reaction carried out at pH 10.0, the 
cyclodextrin therefore substantially increases the percentage of the isatinsulfonate present 
at equilibrium in the neutral, non - hydrated, reactive form. Accordingly, under conditions 
in which indigo and indirubin - 5 ′  - sulfonate are formed in yields of 25 and 1.4%, respec-
tively, in the absence of a cyclodextrin, addition of the urea - linked cyclodextrin dimer 
results in a 22% yield of the indirubin and no indigo was formed within the limits of 
detection ( < 0.1%) (Table  3.1 ). Consequently the molecular reactor changes the ratio of 
formation of the dyes by a factor of more than three and a half thousand, with very little 
loss of yield. In this case   β - cyclodextrin and the dimers joined by oxalamide and succi-
namide groups also favour formation of the indirubinsulfonate by factors of approxi-
mately one hundred, ﬁ fty and three hundred, respectively, because their complexation of 
the isatinsulfonate also increases its reactivity, but their effects are less than those seen 
with the urea dimer because they do not simultaneously template the interaction between 
the sulfonate and indoxyl. 
 3.5  Manipulation of Cycloadditions 
 Cyclodextrins have also been studied as molecular reactors for cycloadditions. To some 
extent reactions of this class are obvious candidates for such investigations since they are 
generally solvent - independent, non - catalysed processes, and factors such as reaction rates 
and regio -  and stereo - selectivity are only affected by the concentrations of the reacting 
species and how those align to react. Through inclusion of the reactants in a cyclodextrin, 
their effective local concentrations can be increased and their relative alignment can be 
altered, to increase the reaction rates and change the product ratios.   β - Cyclodextrin has 
been found to alter the diastereoselectivity of Diels – Alder reactions of cyclopentadiene 
with maleic and fumaric acid derivatives,  20   and accelerate the rates of such reactions by 
factors ranging from ﬁ fteen to more than seven thousand.  21   Different natural cyclodextrins

can have quite different effects. For example, whereas photolysis at 312 nm of aqueous 
solutions of ( E ) - 4,4 ′  - bis(dimethylammoniomethyl)stilbene in the presence of   β -
 cyclodextrin produces the isomeric ( Z ) - stilbene, which undergoes electrocyclisation and 
oxidation to the corresponding phenanthrene, the analogous photolysis performed instead 
in the presence of   γ  - cyclodextrin gives only the [2+2] - cycloaddition products (Figure 
 3.8 ). 22 The difference reﬂ ects the formation of a 1   :   1 host - guest inclusion complex of the 
stilbene with   β - cyclodextrin compared with a 1  :  2 complex with   γ - cyclodextrin. 
 The effects of cyclodextrins on [4+4] - photodimerizations of anthracene derivatives 
have been studied quite extensively.  23,24   For example, it has been found that such reactions 
of anthracene - 2 - sulfonate and  - 2 - carboxylate in water are accelerated by both   β - and 
 γ - cyclodextrin.   γ  - Cyclodextrin has very little effect on the ratio of the four possible 
cycloadducts but, with each of the anthracene derivatives,   β - cyclodextrin increases the 
proportion of the  anti  - head - to - tail cycloadduct from less than 45% to more than 85% 
(Figure  3.9 ). 23 The effects observed with the natural cyclodextrins generally arise from 
the fortuitous way the reagents self - assemble in the cyclodextrin annulus. By comparison, 
modiﬁ ed cyclodextrins offer the additional beneﬁ t of providing a means to control the

assembly of the reacting species, so as to manipulate the outcomes of cycloadditions by 
design. Accordingly, bispyridinio - appended and capped   γ - cyclodextrin derivatives have 
been identiﬁ ed that induce a two -  to ﬁ ve - fold increase in the proportion of the  anti - head -
 to - head cycloadduct formed from anthracene - 2 - carboxylate. 24   They also afford that dimer 
with enantiomeric excesses as high as 35% and there seems to be a general correlation 
between the yield and enantiomeric excess obtained using a particular cyclodextrin 
derivative.   
 We have exploited modiﬁ ed cyclodextrins to reverse the regioselectivity of [3+2] -
 dipolar cycloadditions. Nitrile oxides (dipoles) undergo dipolar cycloadditions with 
alkynes and alkenes (dipolarophiles) to give isoxazoles and isoxazolines (cycloadducts), 
respectively. With monosubstituted dipolarophiles, in principle both 3,4 -  and 3,5 - 
disubstituted cycloadducts could form but, in practice, the reactions generally produce 
mainly the 3,5 - disubstituted - ring system (Figure  3.10 ). 25   Steric effects determine the 
regioselectivity, with the more hindered end of the dipolarophile bonding preferentially 
to the oxygen of the nitrile oxide. For example, the reaction of 4 -  tert - butylbenzonitrile 
oxide with propynamide in water at room temperature produces the corresponding 3,5 - 
and 3,4 - disubstituted isoxazoles in the ratio 4   :   1. However,   β  - cyclodextrin can act as a 
molecular scaffold to change the outcome. By attaching propynamide to the cyclodextrin 
through substitution of one of its primary hydroxy that is should be hydroxyl groups, 
reaction with the nitrile oxide then affords the 3,5 -  and 3,4 - cycloadducts in the ratio 1   :   15 
(Figure  3.11 ). 26   Whereas 80% of the 3,5 - disubstituted species is produced in the absence 
of the cyclodextrin, more than 90% of the opposite regioisomer is formed when it is 
present. This is consistent with the formation of an inclusion complex between the nitrile 
oxide and the modiﬁ ed cyclodextrin, in which the relative orientations of the dipole and 
dipolarophile are controlled (Figure  3.12 ). The importance of this inclusion to the reaction 
outcome is highlighted by the observation that the effect of the cyclodextrin is much less 
both when the reactions are carried out in  N , N  - dimethylformamide instead of water, where 
the extent of host – guest complexation is much less, and in water with nitrile oxides other 
than the  tert  - butylbenzo derivative, that are less hydrophobic and less inclined to include.   
 Similar effects have been observed with azide dipolar cycloadditions.  27   In the system 
directly analogous to that described in the preceding paragraph, reaction of 4 -  tert - 
butylphenylazide with propynamide produces a 2  :  1 ratio of the 1,4 - and 1,5 - disubstituted -
 1,2,3 - triazoles, whereas tethering the propynamide to   β - cyclodextrin changes the ratio

of the corresponding cycloadducts to 1   :   25 (Figure  3.13 ). That is, while 67% of the 
1,4 - disubstituted species is produced in the absence of the cyclodextrin, more than 95% 
of the opposite regioisomer is formed when the cyclodextrin is present. Either the dipo-
larophile or the dipole may be attached to the cyclodextrin to affect the regioselectivity. 
With the azido -   β  - cyclodextrin where azide is substituted for one of the primary hydroxyl 
groups, the reaction with  N - (4 - tert - butylphenyl)propynamide gave an 8  :  1 mixture of the 
1,4 -  and 1,5 - disubstituted triazoles, presumably through formation of a host - guest inclu-
sion complex of the reactants, but with  N - (3,5 - dimethylphenyl)propynamide, where the 
bulk of the aromatic group restricts complexation, the ratio was swapped to 1  :  6.

 Qualitatively, the cyclodextrin increases the rate of these cycloadditions as well as 
affecting the regioselectivity. The extent of reaction of 4 -  tert - butylphenylazide with pro-
pynamide in reﬂ uxing toluene after two days is less than that of the corresponding reaction 
of the cyclodextrin - substituted propynamide at room temperature in water after ﬁ fteen 
hours. A semi - quantitative analysis of this type of effect was performed in water using 
various nitrile oxides each at 1   mM concentration, in competing reactions with propyna-
mide (20   mM) and the cyclodextrin - substituted analogue (2   mM). Despite the use of a 
ten - fold excess of propynamide, benzo - , 4 - phenylbenzo - and 4 - tert - butylbenzo - nitrile 
oxide each reacts selectively with the cyclodextrin derivative, by factors of more than 
two, ﬁ fty and three hundred, respectively. This selective molecular recognition between 
alkynes by the nitrile oxides is complemented by a similar selection between nitrile oxides 
by the cyclodextrin - substituted alkyne. The cyclodextrin (25    µ M) shows a seventy ﬁ ve -
 fold selectivity for reaction with 4 -  tert - butylbenzonitrile oxide (50  µ M) in preference to 
benzonitrile oxide (500  µ M), despite the use of a ten - fold excess of the latter. 
 These trends correspond to pseudo - ﬁ rst order rate constants of 0.5    ×  10  − 3 , 2.0  ×  10  − 3 , 
 > 650  ×  10  − 3  and  > 30  ×  10  − 3  min  − 1  for production of the 3,4 -  and 3,5 - disubstituted isoxa-
zoles from reaction of 4 -  tert - butylbenzonitrile oxide (1  mM) with propynamide (5  mM) 
and the cyclodextrin derivative (5   mM), respectively (Figure  3.14 ). Thus, the cyclodextrin 
moiety increases the rate of formation of the 3,4 - disubstituted isoxazole by more than 
three orders of magnitude. Even the rate of formation of the 3,5 - disubstituted isoxazole 
is increased more than ﬁ fteen times by the cyclodextrin, despite templating of the 
other isomer being preferred. Under analogous conditions, the pseudo - ﬁ rst order rate 
constants for production of the 1,5 -  and 1,4 - disubstituted triazoles from reaction of 4 -  tert - 
butylphenylazide with propynamide and the cyclodextrin derivative are  < 0.1  ×  10  − 5 ,

 < 0.1  ×  10  − 5 , 40  ×  10  − 5  and 2    ×  10  − 5  min  − 1 , respectively (Figure  3.14 ). Therefore, in this 
case, the cyclodextrin moiety increases the rate of formation of the 1,5 - disubstituted tria-
zole by a factor of more than four hundred, and even the rate of formation of the 1,4 -
 isomer is accelerated by a factor of at least twenty. 
 The effects of   β  - cyclodextrin on the regioselectivity of cycloaddition reactions with 
alkynes are also seen with alkenes, as well as when the dipolarophiles are attached to the 
cyclodextrin through ester instead of amide linkages. Under conditions where 4 -  tert -
 butylbenzonitrile oxide reacts with methyl acrylate to give the corresponding 3,5 -  and 
3,4 - disubstituted isoxazolines in the ratio 20   :   1, the acrylate ester formed with   β -
 cyclodextrin through one of its primary hydroxyl groups produces the corresponding 
cycloadducts in the ratio 1   :   20. In this case the cyclodextrin changes isoxazoline formation 
from more than 95% of the 3,5 - disubstituted species to more than 95% of the alternative 
cycloadduct. Similar changes to the ratios of the cycloadducts are observed with the esters 
of  α - methylacrylic and crotonic acid.

 These reactions can be incorporated into a cycle where the cyclodextrin is used and 
then regenerated, although the effect of the cyclodextrin on the regioselectivity is some-
what reduced under these circumstances (Figure  3.15 ).  28   Accordingly, acylation of   β -
 cyclodextrin with 3 - nitrophenyl acrylate, in aqueous solution at pH 9.0 and room 
temperature for eight hours, gives the cyclodextrin acrylate, which undergoes cycloaddi-
tion with 4 - tert - butylbenzonitrile oxide. After a further hour at pH 12.0, to allow for ester 
hydrolysis, adjustment to pH 1.0 gives the 3,5 -  and 3,4 - disubstituted cycloadducts, which 
extract into organic solvent leaving the aqueous solution of the reformed cyclodextrin. 
The ratio of the 3,5 -  and 3,4 - disubstituted isoxazolines obtained in this way is 1   :   2, com-
pared with 20   :   1 from acrylic acid and 1   :   20 from the cyclodextrin acrylate. The inter-
mediate value indicates that not all of the reaction of the 3 - nitrophenyl ester proceeds 
through the cyclodextrin acrylate.

what has already been achieved using cyclodextrin - based molecular reactors. The con-

tions will follow, once the methodology becomes accepted as a way to address particular 
types of problems faced in synthetic chemistry. Meanwhile, there remains a lot of scope 
to develop further methodology in the ﬁ eld. In the last few years entirely new applications 
of cyclodextrin molecular reactors have been developed, for example, in the ring - opening 
polymerisation of lactones,  29   while perhaps the most interesting and potentially important 
report in this area is of the ﬁ xation of nitrogen, through the use of a 1   :   2 complex of 
buckminsterfullerene (C 60 ) with   γ  - cyclodextrin (Figure  3.16 ) in aqueous sodium bisulﬁ te, 
irradiated under nitrogen at atmospheric pressure.  30   These reports indicate that molecular 
reactors, and artiﬁ cial enzymes as they were known earlier, still have considerable poten-
tial for further development and their study continues to be a fruitful area for research.

Reactions Mediated by Cyclodextrins

 4.1  Introduction 
 Cyclodextrins (CDs) are naturally occurring torus - shaped molecules composed of 6, 7, 
or 8 D - glucose units. A fascinating property of CDs is their ability to incorporate other 
organic compounds into their cavities in aqueous solution.  1   Since their discovery, CDs 
have served as prototypes for novel host compounds and catalysts. The use of CDs as 
 microvessels  to perform chemical reactions has attracted the interest of chemists since 
the 1960s.  2   Effects of CDs on reactions are mainly divided into two categories. The ﬁ rst 
effect is the catalytic effect, designated as the  ‘ enzyme model. ’  CD and the reactant ini-
tially form a CD - reactant reaction intermediate involving a covalent bond, which then 
proceeds to product. The second effect does not involve a covalent bond. The cavity of 
CD presents a new reaction environment to the reactant, an  ‘  extra reaction ﬁ eld ’ , in which 
the reactivity, such as rate or selectivity, changes. In these cases, the role of the CD does 
not always catalyze, but  mediates  the reaction. The CD cavity is less polar than the bulk 
aqueous medium. The permittivity in the CD cavity is known to be nearly the same as 
that of dioxane. The microenvironment around the reactant in the CD cavity is different 
from that in the reaction media. Three distinct microenvironmental effects are expected: 
a) microsolvent effects, b) the protection of unstable intermediates or products, and c) the 
solubilization of the reactant. In addition, conformational effects can also be expected:

d) control of the reactant conformation, e) control of the orientation between reactants, 
and f) control of the size of molecule. A combination of several of these effects is evident 
in organic reactions. 
 Many organic, photochemical, radiochemical, electrochemical, and biochemical reac-
tions have been carried out with CD cavities under various conditions, such as in the solid 
phase, in a heterogeneous suspension of water, or in organic solvents. These reactions 
were reported in a previous review. 3   Although the main driving force for formation of an 
inclusion complex between a CD cavity and a guest molecule is the hydrophobic interac-
tion, appreciable selectivity has been achieved in organic solvents such as pyridine, DMF, 
THF, toluene, and CCl 4 . The results in the solid state and in organic solvents suggest that 
other interactions must also be considered. 
 On the other hand, water is of particular interest, because it is a safe, inexpensive, and 
environmentally friendly solvent, which makes its use favorable both in academic labo-
ratories and in industry. The pioneering studies of Diels – Alder reactions in water by 
Breslow 4   in the early 1980s triggered a more widespread interest in the use of water as 
a medium for organic synthesis, not only because these reactions eliminate the necessity 
of vigorously drying solvents and substrates, but also because of the unique reactivity 
and selectivity found in water. Thus, considerable effort has been made in developing 
water - based synthetic organic reactions.  5   Studying organic reactions mediated by CD is 
important not only in supramolecular chemistry but also in green chemistry. The number 
of papers reporting reactions mediated by CDs has been increasing exponentially and it 
would be impossible to cover them in the present limited space. In this chapter, the author 
wishes to indicate the origin of the concept and some representative reactions mediated 
by CDs in water. The  ‘ now ’ and  ‘ then ’ in CD science will be indicated. 
 4.2  The Inclusion Phenomena of Cyclodextrins 
 Before describing organic reactions mediated by CDs, some explanation of the inclusion 
phenomena with CD is warranted, focusing on the complexation mode and interactions. 
Most of our understanding of CD inclusion phenomena has been derived from studying 
the aqueous phase in an equilibrium state. In this state, hydrophobic forces are assumed 
to be responsible for driving a guest into the CD ’ s hydrophobic interior, where a 1   :   1 
host – guest complex usually forms and where there is no interaction with other CD 
molecules. 
 The complexation mode :  stoichiometries ,  conformations ,  and dynamics : The possibility 
of simultaneous formation of complexes with different stoichiometries must also be con-
sidered. Cooperative binding, a bi - molecular process, has been observed, as well as the 
uni - molecular process, producing a 1   :   1 complex in either a  ‘ head - to - tail (HT), ’  ‘ tail - to -
 tail (TT) ’  or  ‘ head - to - head (HH) ’  state. Moreover, a study of the ﬂ uorescence decay of a 
number of anilinonaphthalene sulfonates in the presence of CD supported the view that 
a 1   :   1 complex can be present in several slightly different conformations. There are, in 
fact, various conformations and orientations of reactants as well as varying mobilities in 
reactant - CD complexes. 
 Interactions : The complexation is based on a combination of several intermolecular 
interactions depending on the solvent and the nature of the host and guest: steric ﬁ t, van 
der Waals interactions, dispersive forces, dipole – dipole interactions, charge - transfer

interactions, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding. The choice of reaction 
media used in CD systems also depends on the above combination of interactions. The 
study of organic reactions mediated by CDs means the study of interactions in the CD 
molecule. It should be noted that CD can also include guest molecules in the solid state. 
Such host – guest complexes must clearly be discriminated from other host compounds, 
i.e., clathrates only in the solid state and crown ethers only in solution. Inclusion complex 
formation in the gas phase is expected to be different from that in liquid phases. Short -
 range London forces or polar interactions are responsible for host – guest complexation in 
nonaqueous environments. Clearly, there is the possibility of many kinds of interactions 
to comprise the inclusion phenomena both in solid and solution states. This is the advan-
tage of using CDs for supramolecular functions. 
 4.3  Origin of Microvessels as Molecular Flasks 
 4.3.1  Ternary Complex Formation with  γ - CD 
 γ  - CD has a large cavity, which can accommodate two molecules of naphthalene deriva-
tives. This two - guest inclusion phenomenon in CD chemistry was ﬁ rst reported in   γ - CD -
 induced excimer ﬂ uorescence. 6   Solutions containing only sodium   α - naphthylacetate (NA) 
at a high concentration exhibit a structureless band appearing at a longer wavelength than 
the normal band in the ﬂ uorescence spectrum. This band can be attributed to excimer 
emission since the ratio of intensities of excimer to monomer ﬂ uorescence is proportional 
to the concentration of naphthalene derivatives. Upon addition of   α - ,   β - , and   γ - CD, both 
normal and excimer ﬂ uorescence intensities were markedly enhanced only upon increas-
ing  γ  - CD concentration. The accompanying enhancement of the normal ﬂ uorescence 
might be attributed to the formation of a 1   :   1 complex, but this rationalization was incon-
sistent with the observation that a dilute solution of NA (10  − 4  mol  L  − 1 ) showed no enhance-
ment despite the presence of excess   γ - CD (10  − 2  mol  L  − 1 ). Thus, the enhancement of normal 
ﬂ uorescence was attributed to a 1   :   2 complex formation. This is the ﬁ rst example in which 
two identical molecules were included into a CD cavity. The excimer ﬂ uorescence 
depended on the structure of the naphthyl derivative. It is impossible to predict what kind 
of monosubstituted naphthalene derivatives would be included in the   γ - CD cavity with 
1  :  2 stoichiometry. (Figure  4.1 a). The ﬂ uorescence study also suggested that two different 
kinds of guest molecules could be included in the   γ - CD cavity. 7 The ﬂ uorescence intensity 
of   α  - naphthyloxyacetic acid in aqueous solution was slightly enhanced by the addition 
of  γ  - CD, but markedly enhanced in the presence of both   γ - CD and cyclohexanol, showing 
a ternary complex formation among   γ - CD,   α - naphthyloxyacetic acid and cyclohexanol 
(Figure  4.1 b). These properties of   γ  - CD enabled us to make use of   γ - CD as a reaction 
medium in which two different kinds of molecules, such as a catalyst and a substrate, 
could be brought together effectively. Ueno commented that this phenomenon showed 
that CD  mediates the reactions, in other words,  ‘ CD acts as molecular ﬂ ask ’ in water. 8 
 4.3.2  Organic Reactions Mediated by  γ - CD 
 A modiﬁ ed   γ - CD bearing an  O - 2 - naphthylacetyl substituent produced larger overall ester 
hydrolysis rates in water (pH 8.7)  9   than native   γ - CD. A 12 - fold increase was observed 
for  p  - nitrophenyl acetate, arising from both an increased rate of intracomplex hydrolysis

and stronger binding, and an 11 - fold increase for  m - nitrophenyl acetate, arising from 
stronger binding. The results were presumed to be due to spacer effects of the appended 
naphthalene moiety, which narrows the large   γ - CD cavity. 
 Redox reactions can be controlled by complexes between one host and two guest mol-
ecules. For example, the redox reaction between  N - benzylnicotinamide and ninhydrin was 
affected by the addition of CD.   γ  - CD facilitated the formation of the ternary complex of 
catalyst - substrate -  γ - CD in a 1  :  1  :  1 ratio, in which the redox reaction proceeded. However, 
 β  - CD inhibited the formation of the catalyst - substrate complex, decreasing the reaction 
rate. This is an example in which the CD cavity controlled the catalyst - substrate complex 
formation.  10 
 When   γ  - CD has one naphthyl pendant, it shows normal ﬂ uorescence whose intensity 
is enhanced by the addition of ( − ) - borneol, reﬂ ecting that the naphthyl pendant is included 
with the guest molecule in the   γ  - CD cavity. When naphthalene is added to a solution of 
the host, excimer emission appears as the result of the face - to - face interaction between 
the naphthalene pendant and the naphthalene guest in the cavity. When two molecules 
of the anthracene derivative were attached to the primary hydroxyl side of   γ - CD, 
photoirradiation yielded the capped   γ  - CD with a rigid anthracene dimer on the primary 
hydroxyl side of   γ - CD. The bis(anthracene - 9 - carbonyl) -  γ  - CD system gives only the  trans -
 photodimer as a stable photodimer, but it may be possible to produce several stable 
photodimers if an anthracene - 1 - carbonyl unit was used in place of an anthracene - 9 - 
carbonyl unit. From this viewpoint, Ueno  et al . prepared a series of bisanthracene 
modiﬁ ed - γ  - CDs and used photodimerization in a   γ  - CD as a template. The anthracene 
groups of   γ  - CDs AB, AC, AD, and AE isomers underwent reversible dimerization upon 
irradiation, and afforded capping compounds. Although the  trans - head - tail (HT) or  trans -
 head - head (HH) dimer is usually the favored conﬁ guration in C - 9 - substituted, photoin-
duced anthracene dimers, the product from AB dimers displays a  cis - head - head (HH) or 
 cis - head - tail (HT) geometry only. AB - capped CD was the least stable of the AB, AC, 
AD and AE substituted CDs, owing to the strain within the short bridge. As a result, it 
was demonstrated that the stereochemistry of these bimolecular reactions can be control-
led by this   γ  - CD method. Inoue has also reported that native   γ - CD afforded HT photodim-
ers in good yield and enantioexcess (ee).  11   The stereoselectivity for HH photoproducts 
improved in the anthracenecarbonyl -   γ  - CD system and depended on external effectors, 
such as temperature, solvent and pressure (Figure  4.2 ). 12 
 Higher selectivity has been reported using 3,6 - anhydro -  γ - CD instead of native   γ - CD. 13 
It has been known that anhydro - CD has a distorted cavity. Interestingly, the isomer -  and

enantioselectivity of the photocyclodimerization are switched in the solid state. Solid - state 
photolyses gave inherently disfavored HH photodimers in much higher chemical and 
optical yields than in aqueous solutions. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra indicated that 
the switching of the stereoselectivity is primarily attributable to the varied arrangement 
of anthracene derivative pairs in the ground state. 
 Recently, the efﬁ ciency of CD for the enzymatic synthesis of neoglycolipids, which 
are barely water soluble, was described.  14   Increasing the concentration of   γ - CD led to an 
increase in the limitation of the concentration of the sugar peptide substrate, which sug-
gested that CDs did not work as surfactants or phase transfer systems but as molecular 
recognition systems. CD did not affect the HPLC puriﬁ cation and did not cause any 
lather. These merits are superior to the surfactants commonly used in such cases. In this 
study, a bridge between oligosaccharide synthesis using cell function  in vivo  and enzy-
matic synthesis  in vitro  was constructed which established the possibility of cellular -
 chemoenzymatic synthesis (Figure  4.3 ). 
 4.3.3  Ternary Complex Formation with  β - CD 
 Since the cavity size of   γ  - CD is wider than that of   β  - CD, there should be more reactions 
mediated by   γ  - CD. However, there have been fewer reports of  ‘ mediation ’  with   γ - CD 
than with   β  - CD. Why? To mediate organic reactions with CD, at least two molecules 
must aggregate closely in the CD cavity. We have searched for reports showing a nar-
rower cavity sized CD including two or more guest molecules. Azo - capped CD (AzCD), 
which was prepared from   β - CD and 4,4 ′ - bis(chlorocarbonyl)azobenzene, can form a 
ternary complex with some organic guest molecules (Figure  4.4 ).  15 These remarkable 
complexation properties were studied with the help of CD spectra. The  trans - cis mixture 
in a photostationary state and the  trans  - isomer have distinctly different CD traces, as can 
be seen in Figure  4.5 . The CD bands lose some of their intensity in the presence of guest 
molecules. From the concentration dependence of the ellipticity, conclusions can be 
drawn on both the stoichiometry and the association constant of the inclusion compound. 
The guest molecule, e.g., toluene, cyclohexanol, or methoxybenzene, and the conﬁ gura-
tionally isomeric terpenes, e.g., nerol and geraniol, were included in  cis - AzCD with a 1  :  2 
host – guest stoichiometry, but only in a 1   :   1 ratio in the  trans - AzCD. The complexes of

 cis  - AzCD are more stable than those of the corresponding native   β - CD, whereas the 
 trans  - isomer shows less binding properties. It is interesting that the 1   :   1  cis - AzCD - 
geraniol complex is more stable than the corresponding nerol compound, but that in the 
1  :  2 complexes the situation is reversed. 
 The different complexation properties of the  trans - and  cis  - AzCD are attributed to the 
difference in cavity size induced by the conﬁ guration of the azo double bond. It is assumed 
that the cavity of  cis  - AzCD is deeper than both that of  trans - AzCD and native CD. The 
cavity of  trans  - AzCD might be shallow and broader. This is the reason why the ﬁ rst guest 
molecule binds more strongly than the second.  p - Nitrophenylacetate was hydrolyzed

preferentially by  cis - AzCD over the  trans  - isomer, as deduced from the 5 - fold increase in 
the apparent overall hydrolysis rate.  16   In addition, AzCD displays catalytic activity in the 
hydrolysis of  m - nitrophenylacetate, whereas native   β - CD has  m - selectivity. This inver-
sion is triggered by the deeper cavity space provided by  cis - AzCD, which allows binding 
of the  p - isomer in  cis - AzCD. 
 With chiral guests, both  trans - and  cis - AzCD were found to form 1  :  1 and 1  :  2 host –
 guest complexes, 17   with the  cis  - complex being much more stable. The inclusion behavior 
towards chiral guests was of particular interest. The formation constants for 1   :   2 com-
plexes are summarized in Table  4.1 . Those for the 1   :   1 complex could not be determined 
since the values are too large to be measured. Differences in the formation constants of 
the enantiomeric guest molecules were observed, where the  trans - and  cis - AzCD show 
exactly opposite enantioselectivities. These results could be attributed to the changed 
depth of the CD cavity, from a shallow cavity to a deep one upon  trans  to  cis photo-
isomerization of the cap azobenzene. The stereoselectivity observed might arise from the 
interactions of the guest molecule with the CD rim or wall corresponding to the shallow 
or deep depth of the cavity, although the chiral guest itself might also participate in the 
chiral discrimination. It is assumed that interactions of the guest with the rim or the wall 
of the CD are at the origin of the selectivity. Even though the enantioselectivity of chiral 
guests with AzCD complexes is relatively poor, this can nonetheless be called photocon-
trolled chiral recognition by complexation. 
 These results hold particular interest in the reversed photoregulated system of molecu-
lar functions. Thus, the AzCD results suggested that the cavity of   β - CD can include more

the inclusion with interactions with the wall or cap of the cavity. One of the developing 
ﬁ elds in CD chemistry is  ‘ self - guest modiﬁ cation ’ , 18   in which a   β - CD sensoring system 
has been reported,  19   as well as molecular recognition systems or formation of

 4.4  Organic Reactions Mediated by  CD in Water 
 The main characteristic effect of CDs is improvement of reaction selectivity. Herein, 
several examples of reactions mediated by CD are introduced. The reactions proceed in 
natural and mild conditions, in the presence of CD with water as the solvent. The reac-
tions were achieved in good yields (over 80%) and CD could be reused in the system. 
The reaction conditions are described in the Schemes. 
 4.4.1  Catalytic Systems Based on Metal Complexes 
 Recently, there have been many reports on the effects of CD on metal catalytic systems. 
A potentially interesting approach for the modiﬁ cation of catalytic systems based on metal 
complexes, such as Zn, Mo, Fe, In, Sn, Pd or Ru, involves the use of CD as a protective 
agent. There are many reports on the interaction between CDs and metallic nanoparti-
cles. 20   Immobilized CD on Pd nanoparticles was employed as an efﬁ cient mediator in 
aqueous biphasic hydrogenation reactions (Figure  4.6 a,b). 21 
 Randomly hydroxylated and methylated CD (RM -   β  - CD) with different cavity sizes 
have been used as biphasic aqueous catalysts in a palladium catalyzed Tsuji – Trost reac-
tion with water - insoluble alkylallylcarbonates and alkylallylurethanes as substrates 
(Figure  4.6 c). 22   The reaction rate and substrate selectivity strongly depended on the cavity 
size of the CD. The cavity size is a crucial factor in controlling the substrate selectivity. 
Moreover, phosphanes that did not interact with the methylated CD were the most
