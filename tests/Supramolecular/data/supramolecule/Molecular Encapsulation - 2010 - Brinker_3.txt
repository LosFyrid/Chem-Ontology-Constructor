efﬁ cient mass - transfer promoters in an aqueous biphasic palladium - catalyzed Tsuji – Trost 
reaction. 23 
 The Suzuki reaction is the reaction of an aryl or vinyl boronic acid with an aryl or vinyl 
halide catalyzed by a palladium(0) complex. It is widely used to synthesize polyoleﬁ ns, 
styrenes, and substituted biphenyls, and has been extended to incorporate alkyl bromides. 
Experimentally, the coupling reactions between aryl halides and arylboronic derivatives 
were mainly performed using a phosphine - palladium catalyst in homogeneous, hetero-
geneous, or biphasic systems.  24 RM -  β  - CDs have shown polyvalent properties in a bipha-
sic Pd/C - catalyzed Suzuki – Miyaura reaction (Figure  4.7 ). 25 In addition to their mass 
transfer ability, CDs favored the dispersion of the catalyst in water. With the RM -   β - CDs, 
the gains in initial activities were multiplied by factors between 3.8 and 343 depending 
on the nature of the substrates. This could be explained by assuming adsorption of the 
CD on the surface of the Pd/C catalyst. Indeed, adsorption of CD increases the hydrophilic

character of the support, making its dispersion easier in the aqueous phase. The perform-
ance of this catalytic system is likely a consequence of a combination of two effects: the 
well - known mass transfer promoter properties of the CDs and their dispersing role on the 
Pd/C catalyst. This was the ﬁ rst example of CD - stabilized Pd/C particles for a catalytic 
application. PPV - based polyrotaxanes were prepared by coupling vinyl boronic acids to 
aryl iodides in the presence of   α - or   β  - CDs. The crystal structure of the [2]rotaxane of 
this type was also determined. 26 
 Chiral ruthenium complexes with a monoaminoalcohol modiﬁ ed   β - CD were shown to 
catalyze the reduction of aliphatic ketones with up to 97% ee and in excellent yields in 
the presence of HCO 2 Na. 27   The ratio of catalyst, substrate and sodium formate was 
1  :  10  :  100. Although a number of highly enantioselective ruthenium - based hydrogen -
 transfer catalysts are known, 28 including one example that functions in water, none of 
these systems have been shown to reduce unconjugated ketones.  29   CD made the complex 
soluble in water and played an important role in the enantioselectivity through preorgani-
zation of the substrates in the hydrophobic cavity. 
 The use of CDs in molybdenum - catalyzed oleﬁ n epoxidation may be particularly 
advantageous in cases where the  ‘ free ’  catalyst is initially highly active but loses activity 
during the reaction as a result of decomposition. CD may help to stabilize the metal cata-
lyst and also facilitate subsequent recycling.   η - C 5 H 5 Fe(CO) 2 Cl,   η - C 5 H 5 - Mo(CO) 3 Cl, and 
 η - C 5 H 5 - Mo(CO) 3 CH 2 CONH 2  are included in   β - CD with a 1  :  1 stoichiometry. The latter 
could be used directly as precursors of catalysts for the epoxidation of cyclooctane with 
 t - BuOOH 30 or H 2 O 2 .   β  - CD adducts have the potential to be used both in heterogeneous 
solid - liquid systems and biphasic liquid - liquid systems. The structures of single crystals 
of the   η - C 5 H 5 Fe(CO) 2 Cl and permethylated -  β - CD, heptakis - (2,3,6 - O - methyl) -  β - CD, 
were described. The metal - complex – CD exhibited signiﬁ cant catalytic activity in the 
oleﬁ n epoxidation system with H 2 O 2 , with cyclooctane oxide being the only observed 
reaction product. 31 
 Homoallylic alcohols were directly prepared from aromatic acetals and dioxolanes 
( ≥  80%) using a Barbier - type allylation, Zn/allyl bromide/NH4Cl, in the presence of   β - CD 
in water at 50    ° C (Figure  4.8 ). 32   The synthesis of enantiomerically enriched homoallylic 
alcohols is an important goal in organic synthesis. An enantioselective metal - mediated 
allylation of substituted benzaldehydes with   β - CD was achieved. 33 The reaction proceeds 
in short reaction times (1  h) at room temperature. The homoallylic alcohols are obtained 
in moderate yields with up to 93% enantioexcess. 
 4.4.2  Ring Opening Reactions 
 Reductive ring opening of epoxides with NaBH 4  has also been inﬂ uenced by the addition 
of CDs (Figures  4.9  and  4.10 ). Styrene oxide smoothly underwent a ring - opening reaction 
with NaBH 4  and 2   mol equiv. of a   β  - CD to give 1 - phenylethanol with up to 90% selectiv-
ity. 34   Chiral recognition in the complex formation was excluded as the reason for the 
enrichment of the enantioselectivity. The reaction rate of the NaBH 4  reduction for the 
 β - CD - R  form is faster than that for the   β - CD - S  form, this rate difference giving prefer-
entially the  S  form. Similar phenomena have been reported in oxidations in crystalline 
complexes. 35   The reactions of other aryloxyepoxides were affected by the presence of 
 β - CD to proceed regioselectively. 36   Highly regioselective ring opening of epoxides to

halohydrins has been carried out with hydrogen and lithium halides in the presence 
of  β - CD. 37 
 The   β  - CD inclusion complexes of aryloxyepoxides with amines afforded amino-
alcohols enantioselectively in the solid state. 38   When carried out in water as the reaction 
medium, nearly racemic aminoalcohols were produced. 
 N  - Activated aziridines are versatile intermediates for the synthesis of many biologically 
active compounds. Aziridines can be easily prepared and the inherent ring strain leads to 
high reactivity with various nucleophiles, such as organometallic reagents, Wittig rea-
gents, amines, hydroxyl compounds, and metal halides (InX 3 , NaX, MgBr 2 , CeCl 3 /7H 2 O/
NaI, TMSI). In the presence of   β  - CD, a variety of  N - tosylaziridines underwent regioselec-
tive ring opening with tetrabutylammonium halides (TBAX) at pH 4 and room tempera-
ture to afford the corresponding haloamines ( ≥ 84%). 39 
 α  - Tosylaminoketones could be generated directly from easily accessible aziridines with 
 β - CD and  N - bromosuccinimide (NBS) ( ≥ 85%) in a single step. 40 With the combination 
of  β - CD and NBS,   α  - hydroxymethylarylketones were prepared from oxiranes at room 
temperature within 1 – 2 days. 41   α  - Aminoarylketones provide starting materials for the 
synthesis of biologically active   β  - aminoalcohols. Only a few direct methods have been 
reported for their synthesis. However, these methods have various limitations such as the 
use of transition metal catalysts, organic solvents, controlled temperatures, long reaction 
times, and hazardous reagents. Thus, there is still a need to develop cleaner synthetic 
methodologies for the generation of   α - aminoketones. 
 NBS is a commonly used oxidizing reagent. Selective oxidation of sulﬁ des and addition 
to oleﬁ ns was also mediated by CD. A simple and highly selective oxidation of sulﬁ des 
to sulfoxides with NBS in the presence of   β - CD has been reported (Figure  4.11 a). 42 A 
series of sulﬁ des were oxidized selectively without overoxidation to sulfones ( ≥ 90%). 
The reaction proceeded under neutral and mild conditions and could be carried out easily 
with recycling of CD and regeneration of NBS (Figure  4.11 b).   
 vic - Halohydrins (bromo - and iodohydrins) were synthesized regioselectively in a one -
 step procedure by treating the corresponding oleﬁ ns at room temperature with NBS and

cleaved regioselectivity (Figure  4.11 c). 44 
 The direct one - pot synthesis of   β  - hydroxy selenides was reported. In the presence 
of   β  - CD, highly regioselective ring - opening of oxiranes with benzenesenol was achieved 
( ≥ 75%). 45  β - CD could also be recovered and reused. 
 In the presence of   β  - CD, ring opening of epoxides with various thiophenols proceeds 
with high regioselectivity.   β  - CD can also be recovered and reused in various runs without 
affecting the efﬁ ciency of the process.  46   Highly regioselective ring opening of oxiranes 
to  β  - hydroxy ethers with phenoxides has been achieved ( ≥ 94%). 47   β - hydroxynitriles and 
 β  - aminoalcohols have been synthesized regioselectively from epoxides and  N - tosyl azi-
dines in the presence of   β - CD. 48 
 2 - Iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX) is attractive due to its low toxicity, ease of handling, and 
moisture stability. Various epoxides and aziridines were cleaved with IBX to afford 
 α - hydroxyketones and   α - aminoketones, respectively. 49   Carbonyl compounds were also 
prepared from the corresponding tetrahydropyranyl (THP) ethers directly with IBX and 
 β  - CD. The yields obtained were up to 96% (Figure  4.12 ).  50 No overoxidized products 
were detected in the case of aldehydes. In these reactions, the role of CD appears to be 
to activate the THP ethers by hydrogen bonding and thereby facilitating the hydrolysis. 
Since the   β  - CD cavity is hydrophobic, it may also be forming reversible complexes with 
the THP ethers. When the reaction was performed without IBX, only deprotection 
occurred and no oxidized product was isolated. Without CD, no deprotection took place 
and hence no oxidation occurred.

 4.4.3  Addition 
 Allylation of carbonyl compounds is an important carbon – carbon bond forming reaction 
in organic chemistry for the preparation of homoallylic alcohols. Homoallylic alcohols 
are useful tools for the construction of complex molecules and are important building 
blocks for the synthesis of natural products. A highly efﬁ cient allylation of aldehydes 
with allyltributyltin has been developed mediated by   β  - CD in the presence of HCl without 
any metal catalysts to afford the corresponding homoallylic alcohols ( ≥ 88%: Figure 
 4.8 a). 51   CD can be recovered and reused for a number of runs without signiﬁ cant loss of 
activity. The key process is inclusion in the CD cavity. This process is more important 
than hydrogen bonding between the aldehyde and hydroxyl group on the rim of the CD 
cavity. As described earlier, homoallylic alcohols could be prepared by adding CD to the 
metal catalyzed reaction systems (Figure  4.8 ). 
 The aza - Michael reaction, which is an important reaction for the synthesis of hetero-
cycles containing a  β  - amino carbonyl unit, could be mediated by CD in water to produce 
the corresponding   β - amino compounds ( > 80%) under mild conditions, at room tempera-
ture and for 6 – 8  h reaction time (Figure  4.13 a). 52   Interestingly, Michael additions of 
nitroalkanes to methyl vinyl ketone are also known to occur in the presence of sugars.  53 
No reaction was observed without CD. Hydrogen bonding of amines with the CD hydroxyl 
makes the N – H bond weaker, enhancing the nucleophilicity of nitrogen for addition to 
electron - deﬁ cient alkenes. 
 Michael addition of thiols from the secondary side of   β - CD to   α , β - unsaturated com-
pounds at the primary side was described (up to 97%: Figure  4.13 b).  54   Products of unde-
sirable side reactions resulting from polymerization were not observed. In addition, the 
use of CD precludes the use of either acid or base and the catalyst can be recovered and 
reused.

 3 - Indolyl - 3 - hydroxy oxindoles were prepared by   β  - CD complexes with indoles under

 Phosphorus – carbon bond formation has attracted growing attention because of its 
application in organic synthesis and bioorganic chemistry.   α - Functionalized phosphonic 
acids are valuable intermediates for the preparation of medical compounds and synthetic 
intermediates. 1 - Aminophosphonic acids are important substrates for the corresponding 
 α  - amino acids in biological systems. The Kabachnik – Fields synthesis, which is the most 
convenient method to synthesize 1 - aminophosphonic acids, is catalysed by base or acids 
such as SnCl 2 , BF 3 .Et 2 O and MgBr 2  and cannot be carried out in a one - step operation. 
However,   α - aminophosphonic esters were obtained in a one - pot synthesis with   β - CD 
(45 – 82%) with good purity under mild conditions by the reaction of diethyl phosphate 
with a mixture of aldehyde and amine at reﬂ ux for 12 – 24  h (Figure  4.14 ). 56 
 The Strecker reaction that is the nucleophilic addition of trimethylsilyl cyanide

and the catalyst can be recycled a number of times without loss in activity. No reaction

was observed without CD. The mechanism was suggested as follows: hydrogen bonding 
of the CD hydroxyl with the nitrogen of the imine increases the electrophilicity of the 
imine carbon, thus activating it for attack by the cyanide ion. 
 Monoprotection of amines/amino acids with Cbz – Cl proceeded in only 1   h in high yield 
( ≥ 90%) with 0.1  mol% of   β - CD. 58   This reaction proceeds without the formation of by -
 products and has advantages over existing methods (Figure  4.15 b and  4.15 c). 
 The thiazole ring system is a useful structural motif found in numerous biologically 
active molecules. Addition of thioamide or thiourea to the aqueous solution of phenacyl 
bromide - β  - CD complex gave the corresponding thiazole or aminothiazole, respectively 
( ≥ 82%), without the formation of by - products or rearranged products (Figure  4.16 ).  59 
The role of CD appears to be to activate and solubilize the phenacyl bromide, and 
drive the reaction to completion in decreased reaction times. Without CD, the reaction 
took place but the yields were poor (20%). Selenazoles were also prepared from   α -
 bromoketones and selenourea in the presence of   β - CD at 50  ° C under atmospheric 
pressure. 60 
 The aldol reaction is an important carbon – carbon bond formation reaction in organic 
chemistry. To get high enantioselectivity, the use of a chiral secondary amine, such as 
proline, has been reported. Interestingly, proline - catalyzed aldol reactions do not show 
any non - linear effects. This strategy allows the otherwise challenging cross - aldol reac-
tion between two aldehydes. Proline modiﬁ ed   β  - CD catalyzes the asymmetric aldol 
reaction. 61 The aldol reaction of various aromatic aldehydes with cyclohexanone is 
mediated by the inclusion complex of a proline derivative and  β - CD, yielding hydroxy -
 ketones with an  anti / syn  ratio of up to 99   :   1 and ee values well above 90%.  62 The 
asymmetric catalytic system mediated by sulfated   β  - CD, which can bind an organo-
catalyst of  tert  - butylphenoxyproline and associated hydrophobic reactant in a water –
 organic solvent phase system, has been developed.  63   With this system, only 10   mol% 
of CD induces the highly enantiopure aldol products in near quantitative yields. 
 The use of CD provides a unique way to study the reactivity of cation radicals of small 
oligothiophenes and oligopyrroles in water,  64   especially in the case of bithiophene and 
terthiophene for which the lack of water solubility does not allow such a study. After 
photochemical oxidation, the cation radical leaves the CD host to undergo coupling with 
another cation radical, similar to reactions occurring in organic media, with no reaction 
between cation radicals.

 Fluorinated monomers, 4 - ( N - adamantylamino) - 2,3,5,6 - tetraﬂ uorostyrene and 2,3,4,
5,6 - pentaﬂ uorostyrene, were polymerized in water after complexation with RM -   β - CD 
without the use of surfactants or cosolvents (Figure  4.17 ).  65   CD induced high reactivity

has a strong inﬂ uence on copolymerization parameters compared to the uncomplexed 
monomers.   
 Thiiranes, which are the simplest sulfur heterocycles, are useful from both theoretical 
and synthetic points of view. The most important method for their synthesis is the conver-
sion of oxiranes to thiiranes by an oxygen – sulfur exchange reaction. Oxiranes react 
smoothly with thiourea in the presence of   β  - CD to afford the corresponding thiiranes and 
the  β - CD can be recycled (Figure  4.18 ). 66

 After precomplexation with   β - CD, a variety of alcohols, including aromatic alcohols, 
were oxidized to their corresponding carbonyl compounds in good yields with NaOCl –
 KBr in aqueous solution.  67 A substrate - selective and transition metal - free oxidation 
of benzoic and allylic alcohols with NaOCl oxidant mediated by   β - CD in water was 
developed.  68   In the presence of one molar equivalent of   β - CD, benzyl alcohol, 4 - 
methoxybenzyl alcohol and some primary aromatic alcohols were oxidated to form 
benzaldehyde, 4 - methoxybenzaldehyde and aromatic aldehydes, respectively, at 50    ° C for 
1 – 4  h. When 20% of acetone was added to the reaction system, the yield of aldehyde was 
dramatically decreased. 
 NaBH 4  is the most generally used reduction reagent in aqueous solution, albeit with 
poor selectivity. The highly asymmetric reduction of ketones with NaBH 4 has been per-
formed with crystalline CD complexes since the 1970s.  69,70   It was suggested that hydrogen 
bonding between the carbonyl group of the substrate and the   β - CD secondary hydroxyl 
groups may result in the enantiomeric face - selective attack of the hydride anion.

 Doussot  et al . have reported that regio -  and stereoselectivity in the reduction of sub-
stituted epoxides and aromatic ketones with NaBH 4  in the presence of CDs depended 
mainly on interactions with the wider rim, the secondary hydroxyl side, of the CD. This 
indicates that an alkoxyborohydride intermediate is formed in the ﬁ rst step of the 
reaction. 71 
 Various   α  - azido alkyl ketones were reported to be reduced with good enantiospe-
ciﬁ city by NaBH 4  in the presence of   β  - CD. High enantioselectivity was induced 
by the interaction between the substrate and hydroxyl groups on the wider rim of CD. 
The high selectivity may be due to the stability of the CD – substrate complexes and 
the orientation of the carbonyl group within the complex. Sodium dithionate, which 
is also easily handled and is a water - soluble reducing reagent, has been used with 
 β  - CD for the stereoselective reduction of (R) - ( − ) - carvone, 72 menthone, 73 and compounds 
having carbon – carbon double bonds next to the   α , β - carbonyl group. 74 Interestingly, a 
remarkable effect by CD on the menthone product was found in mixed - solvent systems. 
Aqueous DMF (1   :   1) increased the yield from 14% without CD to 76% with   β - CD 
in water, the menthol/neomenthol ratio being 3.6/1.0 under phase - transfer conditions. 
Lipophilic CD, heptakis(2,6 -  O - methyl) -  β  - CD (DMCD), in a water – benzene mixture 
gave an 82.0% yield with good stereoselectivity (the menthol/neomenthol ratio being 
2.0/1.0). DMCD also affected the reaction of compounds that have carbon – carbon 
double bonds next to the   α , β  - carbonyl group in a water – toluene mixture (1  :  1). Both 
complexation and reduction seem to occur mainly in the organic phase, leading to a 
very high yield. 
 In aqueous or organic solvents, it is possible that the reagent or substrate can still form 
a host – guest complex through speciﬁ c interactions with the CD. Adequate modiﬁ cation 
of the CD to form new interaction points or adequate change of the cavity can be expected 
to result in appreciable ee in an asymmetric reaction. 
 Higher enantioselectivity in the reduction of benzoylformic acid (BFA) using NaBH 4 
has been reported using mono - 6 - deoxyamino -  β - CD (ACD) as the host, instead of   β - CD, 
in neutral aqueous solution.  75   The phenyl group is used to control cavity size and the sp 3 
carbons between the parent CD cavity and the phenyl group act as a ﬂ exible arm. As 
shown in Figure  4.19 , the enantioselectivity was related to the orientation of the substrate 
in the presence of a  ‘ self - guest group ’ . In the case of BFA, when the substrate is held 
between the cavity and the bulky hydrophobic substituent of the modiﬁ ed CD, a higher 
ee is obtained. When BFA cannot participate in self - inclusion, then lower ee ’ s are 
observed. In the case of an oval - shaped substrate, such as indol - 3 - pyruvic acid (IPA), 
which cannot participate in the self - inclusion, but can form an outside complex near the 
rim of the CD derivative, high enantioselectivities were observed with almost all of the 
amino - CD derivatives, irrespective of the position of the substituent.  76 These results 
suggest that the rim of the CD cavity also may lead to substantial improvements in organic 
reactions. 
 Reduction of mononitroarenes mediated by   β - CD has been reported 77 using hydroxide 
ion as a reductant. Ordinarily the reducing ability of OH  −   in water is very low as a result 
of its stabilization by hydration. Reductions by OH  −   have only been observed in aprotic 
organic solvents. CD includes the reactant (nitrobenzene) and the reaction is carried out 
near the rim of the cavity.

 4.5  Conclusion 
 Many organic reactions have been carried out with CD cavities in water. In the early 
stages of CD chemistry, the subject was limited to organic chemistry. Many reactions 
related to the inorganic ﬁ eld have since been reported. The most attractive advantage of 
CD is its  ‘ selectivity ’ , however, the solvation effect cannot be ignored. To develop CD -
 mediated reactions, it is necessary to clarify the reaction mechanism in detail. Complexation 
certainly induces selectivity. Although it is difﬁ cult to elucidate the role of the CD, 
complex orientation in the reaction transition state must be made clear at the molecular 
level. 
 The early stages in CD chemistry presented many chemists with a very impressive 
concept, that of a host – guest complex which has been described as a ball in a bottomless 
pail. We have shown that the ball or guest is not always in the pail cavity. Other interac-
tions play sufﬁ ciently signiﬁ cant roles in that they recognize the ball and thus mediate 
the reaction. Indeed, hydrogen bonding between the guest and secondary hydroxyl groups 
at the wider rim of the cavity are suggested to explain the reaction mechanism. The so -
 called  ‘ rims ’  of the pail also have to be considered. The rims have great potential to 
interact with the guest molecules through hydrogen bonds polar interaction supported by 
the hydrophobic cavity. Without rims, CD cannot mediate that many reactions. This is

the reason why   β  - CD derivatives can mediate many reactions. More recently, computa-
tional chemistry has played a role in understanding CD chemistry. However, the relation-
ship between CD chemistry and molecular modelling has not yet been established. A 
simple and easy method to express the molecular structure based on the practical results 
is needed. CD is not a bottomless pail. Where are the  ‘ hydrophobic ﬁ elds ’ ? Which CD 
has a symmetrical round cavity? CD has carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms forming 
glucose rings. The molecular structure of CD which is drawn in molecular level can 
provide new applications in supramolecular chemistry. For example, molecular drawing 
of the inclusion complex between two   γ  - CDs and two Congo red molecules with MOPAC 
are indicated in Figure  4.20 .  78   The methods with CD are very simple, generating high 
yields in water. Water is a safe, economical and environmentally friendly solvent. Since 
green chemistry has become such an important issue in the 21 st  century, reactions medi-
ated by CD warrant increased attention.

     Zeolites are naturally occurring minerals found in volcanic rocks where they have been 
formed by hydrothermal processes. The term  ‘ zeolite ’  has been introduced by the Swedish 
mineralogist Cronstedt who gave the name according to the observation of the large 
amount of water they release upon heating.  ‘ Zeolite ’  is indeed derived from the Greek 
 ‘ zein ’ (to boil) and  ‘ lithos ’ (stone). 
 Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates materials that possess ordered and intercon-
nected microporous channels with diameters ranging from 0.2 – 20     Å
´ . Their unique proper-
ties (microporosity, high surface area, acid – base character, shape) have made them a 
material of choice in a great number of applications. Zeolites are intensively used in gas 
separation due to their ability to adsorb selectively a large variety of molecules and are 
also known as molecular sieves. Furthermore, these materials are also used as ion exchang-
ers (water softeners) and catalysts in petrochemistry. Currently, the world ’ s annual pro-
duction of natural zeolite is about 4 million tons. Of this quantity, 2.6 million tons are 
shipped to Chinese markets to be used in the concrete industry. The amount of synthetic 
zeolites produced is about 1.5 million tons (Figure  5.1 ).   
 The number of known zeolitic structures is currently 174 but, according to theoretical 
work based on these existing stable structures, there might be several million structures 
available which would be more or less stable. Hence designing a zeolitic material for a

chemical reaction or chemical storage should be feasible and may open new opportunities 
for the use of these materials in the future.  1   Existing computational methods may allow 
to select a zeolite for a targeted reaction product.  2   For instance in biomass conversion, 
novel large pores zeolites may be very adapted to convert oligosaccharide to fuels. 
 Zeolites tridimensional porous structure arises from a framework of [SiO 4 ] 4 −  and 
[AlO 4 ] 5 −  tetrahedra TO 4  linked together by their corners. During the synthesis, these 
primary building blocks assemble by sharing O atoms, thus creating an inﬁ nite lattice 
with identical unit cells. Each Si ion has its 4+ charge balanced by the four surrounding 
O, so that Si tetrahedron is electrically neutral. Hence pure siliceous zeolites are electri-
cally neutral. By replacing part of Si ions with Al (with a formal charge 3+), a negatively 
charged tetrahedron is created. Therefore each Al ion requires a 1+ charge from a cation 
which can be Na + in most of the case and also  NH4
+ or Ca 2+ , K + , and so on. 
 These ions can be reversibly exchanged giving zeolites their most important application 
in ion exchange such as water softener in detergent (largest use) and water puriﬁ cation. 
Among others, H +  counterions may compensate the negative charge as well. The protons 
are formally assigned to be bonded to the bridging O of a Si − O − Al bond, forming 
hydroxyl groups that act as a Br ø nsted acid. The so - called Br ø nsted acid sites are char-
acterized by their acid strength, which depends on their environment, i.e. on the chemical 
composition (density of protonic sites, heteroatoms such as P) and the structure of the 
zeolite (geometry, cages and conﬁ guration).

 The local environment of the acid site is determined by the zeolite topology that 
imposes a deﬁ ned coordination of the TO 4  tetrahedra in the framework. This leads to 
different amounts of topologically non - equivalent TO 4  sites which induce heterogeneity 
in the acid strength distribution as well as a difference in accessibility. Together, the acid 
character of these materials and the pore size of the channels that falls in the range of the 
kinetic radii of many organic molecules give a unique synergy for the use of zeolites as 
acid catalysts in numerous industrial key reactions. 
 As catalysts, zeolites have found their most important application in petroleum reﬁ ning 
processes. Their acid function is used in Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), in hydroisom-
erisation of light alkane fraction as well as in oligomerisation and isomerisation steps to 
upgrade the liquid fuels into gasoline and diesel. The combination of two different zeolites 
in the same industrial process is illustrated in the Shell – UOP TIP process: an acidic 
zeolite, MOR, is used for isomerisation and the neutral LTA is used as molecular sieve 
for separation as shown in the scheme below (Figure  5.3 ).   
 In 1999, Tanabe and Hoelderich  3   have reviewed 74 industrial processes ranging from 
cracking to ﬁ ne chemical synthesis in which zeolites are used as a catalyst. 
 Numerous books and reviews have already been published concerning organic reac-
tions catalysed by zeolites.  4 – 6   Due to their pore sizes, their internal shapes and their 
compositions,  7   zeolites are well known for their selectivity properties, discriminating 
reactants, intermediates, transition states or products. 8

Molecular Encapsulation
 Zeolites can be considered as microreactors and one may ﬁ nd some analogy with 
enzymatic - like systems:  9 
 •      the differential diffusion in the zeolite channels between products and reactants of dif-
ferent size allows a control on the selectivity on chemical reactions,  
 •      the preferential adsorption of molecules in the channels as a function of their polarity 
offers a selective activation of chemical compounds. The electrostatic ﬁ eld inside the 
cavities and channels, depending strongly on the Si/Al ratio, can be tuned by isomor-
phous substitution of Si and Al in the framework. Hence one can drive the adsorption 
selectivity towards hydrophilic/hydrophobic and polar/non - polar molecules by the syn-
thesis of a zeolite with an appropriate Si/Al ratio, 
 •      molecules that are absorbed in a channel or cavity tend to optimize their conﬁ guration 
towards the most favourable Van der Waals interaction with the cavity or channels walls 
under the conﬁ nement effect. When the molecular size of an adsorbate is close to the 
dimension of the cavity or channels, its frontier molecular orbitals HOMO – LUMO are 
strongly affected. It has been evidenced that adsorbed molecules inside a zeolite channel 
or cavity show increased basic character and greater reactivity.    
 Last but not least, as easily recoverable and reusable catalysts, zeolites also allow to 
perform acid - mediated transformations with a clear environmental beneﬁ t, since it avoids 
the formation of huge amounts of salts which is typically encountered in acid catalyzed 
processes. Noteworthy, zeolites can also host active catalytic species such as metals or 
organometallic complexes for ﬁ ne chemical synthesis.

 5.1  The Conﬁ nement Effect 
 The so - called  conﬁ nement effect in microporous and mesoporous materials is known to 
strongly affect diffusion and catalytic properties.  10   Various approaches have been used to 
characterise this effect. Denayer and Baron, in a chromatographic study of the adsorption 
properties of linear alkanes in various mesoporous materials, proposed to deﬁ ne a conﬁ ne-
ment factor Z as the ratio of adsorption entropy over adsorption enthalpy.  11 For non - polar 
molecules, the adsorption enthalpy reﬂ ects the energetic interaction between the molecule 
and the zeolite force ﬁ eld and increases with decreasing pore size. The adsorption entropy 
relates to the amount of freedom lost by going from bulk state to adsorbed state. Using 
calorimetry, gravimetry and in - situ infrared spectroscopy, Lercher and Eder showed that 
the apolar alkanes are very locally adsorbed via hydrogen bonding. By monitoring the 
disappearance of infrared absorption bands of O − H groups from the zeolite, they were 
able to distinguish a precise population of protons that are involved in the adsorption of 
alkanes. For instance, with  n  - hexane and zeolite Mordenite (MOR), they convincingly 
showed that only protons in 12 and 10 membered ring pores were involved in hydrogen 
bonding with the alkane whereas the protons located in 8 membered ring pores the sorp-
tion was hindered. The hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group of the zeolite and 
the hydrocarbons induces a dipole in the hydrocarbon that is at the origin of their 
reactivity. 12,13 
 The conﬁ nement effect has been evidenced both by quantum chemical calculations as 
well as spectroscopic investigations on naphthalene molecule entrapped within a zeolite 
by the group of A. Corma.  9,14 – 17   As an example, the aromaticity of anthracene was strongly 
perturbed due to limitation of the   π  - orbital spatial extension induced by the proximity of 
the pore walls depending on the size of the pores. This  ‘ electronic conﬁ nement effect ’ is 
particularly large when a tight host – guest conﬁ guration occurs. It has been suggested that 
this effect implies important consequences in terms of reactivity, particularly for the reac-
tions involving electric charge donation from the guest molecule to the zeolite framework 
atoms. Reactions, like proton transfer for example, will be favoured in conﬁ ned systems 
where the rise in the frontier occupied molecular orbitals will make the electronic transfer 
easier. An other example is provided in a computer modelling study of acetonitrile adsorp-
tion in Mordenite:  19   the nitrogen atom of the molecule in the side pockets favours interac-
tion with the proton of an OH group in these conﬁ ned sites. The role of side pockets has 
also been demonstrated in many other cases.  18,19 
 Remarkably, the conﬁ nement in the small channels of Mordenite zeolite (side pocket) 
polarizes signiﬁ cantly the acetonitrile molecule toward protonation. It leads to a long 
residence time of the adsorbate in the neighbourhood of the acidic hydroxyl group, and 
modiﬁ es greatly the charge distribution (even in a silicic zeolite), contributing to the 
explanation of the preferred protonation of acetonitrile in side pockets of acidic Mordenites. 
 In a more intuitive way, Derouane 20 proposed that zeolites should be considered as 
solid solvents, a concept very familiar to organic chemists. 
 By the characterisation of the acidic OH groups in zeolites of different types, Hunger  18 
interpreted NH 3 – TPD results in the light of conﬁ nement effects: in the Faujasite (FAU) 
structure, a bimodal distribution of adsorption energies in both the supercages and the 
sodalite cages was found, with the stronger acid sites being more common in the super-
cages. In contrast, essentially the same acid strength for different regions in MOR is seen,

though the acid strength for the sites located in the side pockets may be slightly higher. 
For FER and MFI, the TPD gives unimodal distributions and therefore prohibits distinc-
tion between different regions.   
 Using a mesostructured aluminosilicate of the MCM - 41 type with the same composi-
tion but varying the pore size from 2.3 to 9.3   nm, Tanchoux  et al . 21   measured the adsorp-
tion energetics and the catalytic isomerisation of 1 - hexene. The authors could demonstrate 
that the geometry - dependent contributions dominated catalytic behaviour over all other 
factors. 
 However, for the understanding of catalytic hydrocarbon conversion over solid acid 
catalysts, there is still a sharp contrast between the general agreement on the similarity 
with carbocation chemistry and the lack of experimental information on the mode of 
formation or the nature of the carbocationic intermediates.  22,23   Many years ago, on the 
basis of the initial product distribution in the cracking of light alkanes at high temperature, 
the Haag – Dessau mechanism 24,25 (sigma - bond protolysis as in superacids 26 – 28 ) was sug-
gested, but hydride abstraction, oxidation and alkene impurities have also been suggested 
as possible ﬁ rst step in the formation of the reaction intermediates. 29 – 31 
 It has been shown that simple carbenium ions can only be considered as transient 
species (unless with a large charge distribution) within the zeolite channels and that the

most stable intermediates are the framework - bound alkoxy species  32 – 34 . However, the 
existence of carbocations as short - lived reaction intermediates  35   in equilibrium with the 
alkoxy species is supported by the Koch reaction,  36,37   halogen switch reaction  38 or H/D 
exchange reactions 29,30 observed in reactions catalysed by zeolites. 
 Based on  ab initio  calculations using a FAU supercage as model, Van Santen and 
Pitko 39   demonstrated that the role of the zeolite framework in the photooxidation of 
alkenes with molecular oxygen is the complexation of the hydrocarbon and O 2  to the 
exchanged cations, resulting in conﬁ nement of these molecules with a speciﬁ c relative 
orientation. This leads to the formation of a   π – π  intermolecular complex. The interaction 
between alkene and oxygen in this complex occurs with a ﬁ nite overlap of the involved 
orbitals. The formation of such a complex results in a signiﬁ cant transition moment of 
the intermolecular charge transfer. The role of the electrostatic ﬁ eld of the zeolite is only 
indirect. It stabilizes the reagents in a suitable  ‘ pre - transition state ’ conﬁ guration. For the 
model DFT calculations a Mg 2 Al 14 Si 12 O 20 H 24 cluster was chosen. 
 Partial oxidation of aromatics is one of the most challenging reactions in the ﬁ eld of 
organic synthesis. Oxidation of benzene to phenol using N 2 O as oxidant on ZSM - 5 - type 
catalysts between 300 and 400    ° C could be achieved with a selectivity close to 100%.  40,41 
A substitution mechanistic scheme involving the formation of a hydroxyl group bonded 
to the zeolite surface (HO – ZSM - 5) and its further attack on benzene was proposed. 42 
 The density functional theory study considering the possible reaction intermediates also 
conﬁ rmed the possible formation of protonated nitrous oxide, leading to a Wheland - type 
intermediate, thus supporting an electrophilic aromatic substitution assisted by the con-
ﬁ ned environment provided by the active zeolite framework. 
 Acid form of zeolite H – ZSM - 5 (MFI type) has particularly attracted attention since 
researchers at Mobil have developed the methanol to gasoline process. In this process, 
small pores zeolites with 8 -  to 12 - membered rings have shown outstanding catalytic 
activities in the transformation of methanol (C 1 alcohol) into alkanes in the gasoline range

but also into oleﬁ ns in the methanol to oleﬁ n reaction (MTO).  43,44 Interestingly, the 
product distribution can be controlled by the zeolite properties among other parameters. 
For instance, the reaction could be directed towards the production of light oleﬁ ns such 
as the key industrial ethylene and propylene using a small pore zeolite with a modiﬁ ed 
chemical composition (silica – alumina – phosphate known as SAPO, AlPO … ). As a typical 
example, the SAPO - 34 being an 8 - membered ring zeolite (chabazite - type, CHA) is less 
acidic compared to its silica – alumina (H – CHA) equivalent and allows a very high selec-
tivity to ethylene and propylene when used in a properly designed reactor. Hydro/UOP 
process, which is developed in Norway, allows the selective production of ethylene or 
propylene using a silico – alumino – phosphate zeolite. 45 Methanol conversion to valuable

 Scheme 5.4   Methanol to oleﬁ ns general simpliﬁ ed reaction scheme  
products is obviously of primary importance and will probably gain even more importance 
as oil resources are progressively depleted. 46 
 From a mechanistic point of view, the C − C coupling is of utmost interest because it 
may eventually allow the selective synthesis of valuable alkanes and oleﬁ ns (Scheme  5.4 ). 
Despite experimental observation of formation of methyl groups on the surface of zeolites 
at the early stage of the reaction  47 – 50   and an ongoing research on the possible impurities 
triggering the ﬁ rst C − C formation, there is still a debate over the molecular mechanisms 
involved at the beginning of the reaction. Although computational studies usually exclude 
the formation of oxonium ylide  51   (Scheme  5.5 ) due to the lack of basicity of the zeolites 
framework, the role and the nature of impurities at the origin of the so called carbon pool 
are still quite obscure. 
 For the latter steps, there is a general agreement that the production of light alkanes 
and oleﬁ ns in zeolite is auto catalyzed by large aromatic rings  52   that are formed within 
the zeolites channels and have been evidenced by spectroscopy.  53 – 56 Although a similar 
chemistry is also observed on non - zeolitic materials,  57 – 60   the selective production of eth-
ylene and propylene may probably be enhanced by the zeolites cage effects. 
 Strong effects of the pore size and the shape of zeolites have been clearly evidenced 
in the case of alkanes having comparable molecular dimensions. Remarkable contribu-
tions have shown that the adsorption enthalpy of alkanes is strongly dependent on both 
the topology of the zeolite and the branching and geometry of the alkanes  12 . The adsorp-
tion enthalpy becomes higher as the number of carbons in the alkane increases. Some 
critical carbon numbers have been recently found by Denayer  et al . depending on the 
cage size of the zeolite. These authors have rationalised their results by the spatial demand 
of the alkane within the zeolite.  61   As long as the alkane can ﬁ t inside a single zeolite cage, 
they have observed the well known linear increase of enthalpy of adsorption with increased 
number of carbons. At some point, they showed that the enthalpy does not increase lin-
early anymore and they have argued that the spatial constraint within the zeolitic cage 
impose a geometrical rearrangement of the alkane itself. Further, for higher carbon 
numbers, the linear increase of adsorption enthalpy has again been observed with increas-
ing carbon numbers. That phenomenon was attributed to the adsorption of large alkane 
in two neighbouring cages.

 Another remarkable demonstration of the conﬁ nement effect was described in the 
carbonylation of dimethyl ether by Iglesia and co - workers.  62   Surface methoxy groups are 
the simplest and most stable alkoxide species because they cannot deprotonate to give 
more stable products under mild conditions. The reactivity of surface methoxy with CO 
is very different from one zeolite to another. In their experimental work Iglesia  et al . have 
observed that the rate of carbonylation of dimethyl ether is much higher in the case of 
H – MOR than for other zeolites. H – MOR consists of 12 - membered ring main channels 
intersecting 8 - membered ring channels (also known as  ‘ side pockets ’ ). They have been 
able to show experimentally that methyl groups located in these side pockets are much 
more prone to the carbonylation than those located in the 12 - membered ring main chan-
nels. The molecular architecture of the side pockets may be particularly favourable to 
stabilize the acylium like transition state or may impose the reaction between approaching 
CO and surface methyl groups because of the constrained space. These studies clearly 
demonstrated the role of the local structure of the zeolites on the reactivity of methoxy 
groups with CO which acts as a nucleophile in this case. Furthermore, Iglesia  et al . have 
published a note about the thermodynamics in small alkanes (C3 – C6) C − C bond activa-

tion. In monomolecular cracking of these alkanes the turnover rate increases with the 
number of carbons of the alkane chain while the activation energy remains size independ-
ent. The increase of turnover rates of the cracking reaction was explained by the con-
comitant increase of activation entropies. 63 
 Last but not least, the versatility of zeolites is demonstrated by exchanging the acidic 
proton with deuteron which enables investigation of interesting mechanisms related to 
catalysis and by exchanging the proton with transition metal cations, such as Cu(I), and 
opens new areas of environmentally friendly organic chemistry. For these reasons, we 
are including in this chapter acidic - zeolite catalysed reactions from our own work which 
can be best understood as examples of conﬁ nement effects: superelectrophilic, Cu(I) cata-
lysed Click chemistry, and speciﬁ c H/D exchange reactions. 
 5.2  Superelectrophilic Activation in Zeolites 
 The term  ‘ Superelectrophile ’  was suggested by Olah in the early seventies when it was 
noticed that acylation of chlorobenzene by acetyl tetraﬂ uoroborate was substantially 
accelerated in the presence of the corresponding Br ø nsted acid. 64 
 Superelectrophilic intermediates 64   are typically generated when a cationic electrophile 
is further protonated or coordinated by a Lewis acid to produce a dicationic species.

 Similarly, superelectrophilic solvation  65   may also involve weaker interactions without 
forming limiting dications resulting in enhanced electrophilic reactivity. In order to be 
involved in superelectrophilic activation the starting molecule is best bifunctional. 
 In the last two decades many useful reactions and synthetic approaches involve supere-
lectrophilic activation of reagents mediated by liquid superacids or by excess of alu-
minium halides. As an example,   α , β  - unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, acids or amides, 
readily condense with aromatics such as benzene and dichlorobenzene which are poor 
nucleophiles, but only in the presence of a large excess of aluminium chloride or triﬂ ic 
acid. This reactivity has been interpreted by the intermediacy of dicationic species. 
 Reaction kinetics, 66 theoretical calculations 67 and ﬁ nally the observation of such species 
by NMR in superacids  68   as stable dications point out the reliability of this mechanistical 
hypothesis under superacidic conditions. 
 Zeolites have been successfully applied in similar reactions. As the acidity of 
H – zeolites 69 – 70  , is generally considered to be well below that of superacids  26 
( − 12  <  Ho  <  − 24), the hypothesis of identical dicationic intermediates may be easily 
discarded, but we assume that conﬁ ned space may allow a strong activation by imposing 
a strong interaction between protons of the surface and the electrophile. In other words, 
the framework of the solid acid may provide close proximity of acidic sites enabling the 
formation of diprotonated (or coordinated) species. Moreover, an effective compensation 
of comparatively low proton acidity of zeolites may be obtained due to nucleophilic 
assistance of the lattice oxygens in the transition state of a concerted mechanism resulting 
in an increase of the protonation rate.  71   Similarly, the enzyme mediated protonation of a 
heterocyclic carbocation  72   provides an example showing that structural factors of acids 
can have a profound inﬂ uence in electrophilic activation.

 The arylation of naphthol, which does not occur in the presence of triﬂ ic acid was 
successfully achieved by using benzene as solvent in a pressure tube at 130    ° C with 
H - USY with 72% yield. 73 
 As a further example,   α , β  - unsaturated carbonyl compounds possess two sites which 
can undergo reduction: the carbonyl group and the adjacent C − C - double bond. While an 
abundant literature is available on the selective reduction of the carbonyl group, often 
achieved with relative ease, the selective hydrogenation of the double bond suffers from 
the lack of simple methods using practical chemicals. Selective ionic hydrogenation 
of   α , β  - unsaturated carbonyl compounds with cyclohexane was previously known to 
proceed only in superacidic conditions due to the necessity of dicationic, superelec-
trophilic activation of the enones. H - form zeolites with acidity well below superacidity 
are however also able to induce the reduction of   α , β - unsaturated carbonyl compounds 
with cyclohexane, in analogy, or sometimes even better than the  ‘ parent ’ , superacid medi-
ated reactions. 52,74 
 Furthermore, arylvinylketones were efﬁ ciently converted to indanones using zeolite 
to  promote cyclization. 75   Indanones are indeed one of the most useful family of com-
pounds, which can be obtained from arylvinylketones, since they are the basis of many 
biologically active compounds including indacrinones, indanoyl isoleucine conjugates, 
indanocines and other medicinally important products. 
 The zeolite nature and the substitution pattern in the starting materials proved critical: 
2 - substituted arylvinylketones reacted more readily in H – ZSM5, giving high yield ( > 90%)

of the corresponding indanones, while the 3 - substituted are more efﬁ ciently converted to 
the corresponding indanones by H – USY. However in the presence of a more nucleophilic 
aromatic solvent such as toluene competitive alkylation is observed. 
 The interaction of   α , β  - unsaturated carboxylic acids with benzene derivatives was 
investigated in H – zeolites and led to two distinct but competing processes, cycliacyaryla-
tion and decarboxyarylation. Interestingly, H – USY selectively induced the cycliacyaryla-
tion cascade reaction, whereas H – ZSM5 selectively promoted decarboxyarylation. 76 
 Recently, for the ﬁ rst time, copper(I) - exchanged zeolites were developed as catalysts 
in organic synthesis. 77 These solid materials proved to be versatile and efﬁ cient hetero-
geneous ligand - free catalytic systems. Cheap and easy to prepare, these catalysts exhibited 
a wide scope and a good compatibility with functional groups. They are very simple to 
use, easy to remove (by simple ﬁ ltration) and they are recyclable. 
 5.3  Huisgen [3+2] - Cycloadditions 
 The ﬁ rst application we found was the Huisgen [3+2] - cycloaddition, between a terminal 
alkyne and an azide, to date the most practical and useful  ‘ click ’  reaction, regioselectively 
affording 1,4 - disubstituted 1,2,3 - triazoles (Scheme  5.14 ). 
 Investigations with deuterated alkynes and deuterated zeolites proved that this Cu(I) –
 zeolite - catalysed  ‘ click ’  reaction exhibited a mechanism different from the one reported 
for the Meldal – Sharpless version. which relies on the intermediate formation of copper 
acetylides (Scheme  5.15 ). Therefore, if such species were also formed within zeolites, 
deuteroalkynes would not give deuterated triazoles as observed. (Scheme  5.16 ) 
 We have also shown that copper(I) - modiﬁ ed zeolites can be used as catalysts for the 
[3+2] cycloaddition of pyrazol - 3 - one ylides with alkynes. 78 This heterogeneous method 
offers a mild and efﬁ cient access to tetrahydropyrazolo[1,2 - a]pyrazol - 3 - ones with a rea-
sonably wide scope, tolerating various functional groups, and with high regioselectivity.

 Experiments with labelled materials suggested in this case involvement of copper

 5.4  Multicomponent Reactions 
 One of the fundamental aspects in  ‘ Green Chemistry ’  is linked to the number of steps in 
organic synthesis as well as atom economy. Multicomponent reactions (MCR) are thus 
becoming a more and more important class of reactions since they allow combining 
several starting materials in usually a single compound and in a one - ﬂ ask operation. 
 Cu(I) - modiﬁ ed zeolites, especially Cu(I) – USY, proved to be very efﬁ cient catalyst in 
multicomponent reaction. 80   Such catalysts allowed for an efﬁ cient,  solvent - free synthesis 
of propargylamines from aldehydes, amines and terminal alkynes with high yields. 
 Propargylic amines are high value building blocks in organic synthesis, and the 
corresponding structural motif has been found in various natural products, and in com-
pounds of pharmaceutical or phytoprotective relevance. They can be obtained by addition 
of alkynes to imines, but since imines are easily formed from aldehydes and amines,

3 - component versions are known, either as such or promoted by various transition metals. 
A few supported versions or versions based on heterogeneous catalysts have recently been 
described, but zeolite - catalyzed version has only been reported recently. 
 Based on the use of deuteroalkynes the mechanism was suggested to involve copper –
 acetylides (Scheme  5.19 ). 
 In our experimental work on small alkanes activation on solid acids and zeolites we 
have also observed a very close relationship between zeolitic structure and alkane reac-
tivity. The ﬁ rst observable interaction of hydrocarbons with the acidic protons on the 
surface of the catalyst consists of a fast hydron exchange that can be monitored using 
isotopic labelling. 81 This technique has been applied with various small alkanes as probes 
in order to understand the activation mechanism. For instance in the case of isobu-
tane 29,82,83 a regiospeciﬁ c exchange on the methyl groups was observed in the H/D 
exchange reaction with solid acids being in agreement with a general mechanism based 
on intermediate carbenium ions (classical trivalent carbocation). Once the carbocation is 
generated it is in equilibrium with its corresponding oleﬁ n on the surface by a fast 
deprotonation/reprotonation step. Similarly, we  84,85 and others 86,87   have studied more 
recently both the H/D exchange and the skeletal rearrangement in the reaction between 
propane and sulfated zirconia as well as zeolite using deuterium and carbon - 13 as labels. 
With the help of  in situ  solid state MAS NMR the intra -  and intermolecular rearrange-
ments in propane were fully characterized providing strong evidences for a mechanism 
based on carbenium ions. Again the fast deprotonation/reprotonation process involving 
the equilibrium between the  sec  - propyl carbenium and propene, explains the Markovnikov -
 type incorporation of deuterium in the methyl group. In the aim to correlate better the 
acidity to the proton transfer it is preferable to study alkanes that cannot form an oleﬁ n 
by deprotonation such as methane and neopentane (2,2 - dimethylpropane). As methyl 
cations are not generated under mild condition, due to their high energy, methane does 
undergo H/D exchange on solid acids without secondary reaction.  88,89 This exchange can

only be possible via a concerted mechanism in which the transition state resembles that 
of a carbonium ion presenting a 2electron - 3centre bond as in protonated methane. This 
species can be considered as the conjugated acid of methane. Non - classical cations were 
earlier suggested as transition state or strongly solvated intermediates in the H/D exchange 
reaction between methane and superacids DF/SbF 5 90 or DSO 3 F/SbF 5 . 91 While the reactiv-
ity of hydrocarbons in liquid superacids is clearly due to the   σ - basicity of their C − H 
bonds, 66,92   the mechanistic pathway involves the surface of solid acids and the participa-
tion of nucleophilic oxygen lone pairs compensating the lack of superacidity and stabiliz-
ing charges. 93 – 95 
 2,2 - Dimethylpropane (neopentane) is a  ‘ limiting ’  case on the   σ - basicity scale for 
alkanes 96   because protolysis can only take place either on a primary C − H bond or on a 
C − C bond. Its behaviour in superacids has been studied in the late 1960s by Olah  et al . 
in HSO 3 F/SbF 5 97,98   and Hogeveen  et al . in HF/SbF 5 . 99   Depending on the acidity and steric 
factors, protolytic cleavage takes place either on the C − H bond or on a C − C bond, dem-
onstrating the close basic character of both   σ  - bonds. Neopentane cracking has been previ-
ously studied over solid acids such as silica – aluminas, protonic zeolites  100 – 102 metal 
exchanged zeolites,  103,104   promoted and unpromoted sulfated zirconia.  105 The analysis of 
products distribution has revealed a protolytic cleavage of the C − C bond yielding methane 
and the adsorbed  t - butyl cation as primary products. 
 The C − H bond activation characterized by H/D exchange with solid acids allows 
ranking solid acids by their activity and acidity.  106   Moreover neopentane being a bulky 
probe 107 is sensible to steric hindrance and conﬁ nement effect. 108 
 In full agreement with Haag and Dessau hypothesis,  24 the ﬁ rst step consists in the 
protolysis of a C − C bond leading to the carbonium species (I) as a discrete intermediate 
or a transition state. In the next step methane and the adsorbed  t - butyl cation are simul-
taneously formed and further deprotonation of the latter leads to various oligomerisation/
cracking reactions (Scheme  5.20 ). Intermediate II was generally discarded in the litera-
ture, mainly because it would generate the primary highly energetic neopentyl cation. 
While this second pathway was highlighted in superacidic media by the formation of  t -
 amyl cation resulting from the 1,2 methyl shift, several authors described the C − C bond 
protolysis as the major pathway on solid acids rather than the C − H bond protolysis. 106 – 111 
We have shown that the species II should not be neglected as a direct exchange between 
primary protons and the solid acid was observed.  106 
 5.4.1  H / D Exchange Between Neopentane and Zeolites 
 Neopentane was recirculated on deuterated zeolites (D – MOR, D – FAU, D – ZSM - 5, 
D – BEA) at temperatures between 473 and 573  K. H/D exchange took place without any 
side reaction at the beginning of the reaction and the ﬁ rst order rate of deuteration of 
neopentane itself was determined at short contact times. It should be pointed out that the 
isotopomers of neopentane are formed in a consecutive way: D1 → D2 → D3 → D4  … and 
so on. This corresponds to an H/D exchange reaction where one hydron is exchanged at 
a time. At higher temperatures, the competitive C − C bond cleavage takes place in a non 
negligible rate. For this reason we have limited our study to the H/D exchange of neo-
pentane as follows: on D – USY between 523 and 573   K, D – BEA 513 – 548  K as well as 
D – ZSM5 (513 – 543  K) following the same experimental procedure.

 5.4.2  H / D Exchange Between Neopentane and Zirconia 
 Sulfated zirconia is known to activate hydrocarbons at low temperature.  109   In the case of 
the well studied  n  - butane isomerization, but also for propane rearrangement the ﬁ rst step 
is most probably an oxidative dehydrogenation.  110,111   The synthesis of the material con-
stitutes also a crucial point for its activity towards alkanes.  112,113   The catalyst we used in 
this study readily exchanged its deuterons with the hydrons of neopentane in the tempera-
ture range of 483 – 513  K. At higher temperature C − C protolysis competes signiﬁ cantly 
with H/D exchange. The experimental results have highlighted the ability of acidic sites 
of sulfated zirconia to generate a carbonium ion (species II, scheme  5.20 ) at such moder-
ate temperature. Sulfated zirconia apart from its well known oxidative properties exhibits 
sufﬁ ciently strong acid sites allowing the generation of a pentacoordinated carbon simi-
larly to carbonium - type ions in liquid superacids. 
 5.4.3  H / D Exchange and Acidity 
 The analysis of kinetic data of the H/D exchange allowed us to determinate the activation 
energies for each solid acid. The Eyring equation separates the free enthalpy from the 
entropic contribution for a better comparison and comprehension of the transition state 
involved in the proton transfer process. 
 Figure  5.8  shows that the free enthalpy of activation   ∆ H# of the H/D exchange between 
neopentane and zeolites is very close for all zeolites tested. The similarity of these values 
is consistent with a common transition state in the H/D exchange step on zeolites. Further

acids 106 
MFI, USY, respectively) revealed an important participation of the surface in the transition 
state, constraining the transition in a deﬁ ned geometry. In other words, the signiﬁ cant loss 
of entropy evidenced a strongly concerted mechanism with the surface. 
 Species II (Scheme  5.20 ) should rather be represented as an activated complex in which 
the surface of the solid acid delocalizes extensively the charge as proposed earlier.  97 – 99 
Accordingly, the value   ∆ H# calculated for sulfated zirconia differed markedly from those 
of zeolites, most probably due to the difference in chemical composition of the surface. 
This result constitutes a further proof of the strong involvement of the surface in the 
transition state. This situation is nevertheless very similar to what happens in liquid 
superacids for the activation of methane. In a previous study, the H/D exchange between 
methane and DSO 3 F/SbF 5  –  varying the SbF 5  concentration  –  showed not only a unique 
transition state for all systems but also a strong participation of the anionic part in the 
transition state. Hence, an analogy between these superacidic media and zeolites was 
proposed on the basis of kinetic analysis, and the rate of exchange at a given temperature 
should correlate directly with the acidity of the system. 
 Remarkably, at 523   K the rates of exchange were found to be in the same order of 
magnitude for all zeolites tested. In agreement with the previous studies on neopentane 
cracking, mordenite showed the highest activity among zeolites. Again, in full analogy 
with previous results in superacids,  98   since the transition state is unique for all zeolites as 
well as in the case of the exchange between CH 4  and DSO 3 F/SbF 5 , we suggested that the 
activity in H/D exchange can be related to the acidity of zeolites. The order of activity 
appears to be the following: MOR > MFI > BEA > FAU. Generally the Si/Al ratio is consid-
ered as a major parameter to characterize the acidity of the zeolites. Nevertheless Si/Al 
ratio difference in this study was not sufﬁ cient to explain the difference observed for the 
activity in H/D exchange. In fact the activity of zeolites seemed to ﬁ t more with the size

of the pores. Considering the most conﬁ ned space or the smallest pore of zeolite allows 
ﬁ nding the order of activity of zeolites in H/D exchange with neopentane. The closer the 
molecular size of the probe ﬁ ts with the pores, the more basic the probe becomes, thus 
facilitating the acid catalysis. Busca  et al . and Thibault - Starzyck  et al . have very recently 
published their results concerning the adsorption of nitriles and pyridines in zeolite.  114 – 117 
It is very interesting to note that acetonitrile can enter such small pores as the  ‘ side 
pockets ’  of Mordenite (3.4    ×  4.8  Å ) at low temperature. In contrast these authors demon-
strated by IR spectroscopy that pivalonitrile could not enter these small pores and remains 
in the main channel of Mordenite. Neopentane is an isolobal analog of pivalonitrile having 
a diameter of 6.2    Å  which prevents the entry in the  ‘ side pockets ’ . However, computa-
tional studies showed clearly that a methyl group having a critical diameter of 4    Å enters 
the  ‘ side pockets ’  of mordenite when temperature is increased.  117   Indeed the increase of 
temperature implies a greater ﬂ exibility of the framework and allows the distortion of the 
molecular probe. 118,119 On the same basis Nascimento has also shown that neopentane can 
enter the MFI channel (5.3    ×  5.6  Å ). 120   Taking into account these results, it seems that the 
order of activity of the zeolites we present here emphasizes the conﬁ nement effect. 
Mordenite is the most active catalyst for the H/D exchange of neopentane as well as for 
its cracking and H/D exchange takes place at lower temperature than with the other zeo-
lites. Considering the  ‘ side pockets ’  as ideal sites where the methyl group of neopentane 
can be optimally protonated can explain these experimental data. Therefore the order of 
activity found for H/D exchange between zeolites and neopentane seems to be strongly 
related to the size of the pores.  
 5.5  Conclusion 
 Never has the need for Green Chemistry and clean technology using processes that gener-
ate little or no waste, been greater than at present. 
 Zeolites are important molecular sieves or heterogeneous catalysts which may operate 
under mild and environmentally benign conditions preferably without use of non - aqueous 
or any other solvents. They present the advantages, in comparison with previously used 
alumina - based catalysts, of having a better long - term stability, and yielding higher product 
selectivity. The higher selectivity of this class of catalysts originates from the well - deﬁ ned 
micropore structures of the zeolite crystals, which lead to size - and shape - dependent 
adsorption, reaction, or diffusion of the reactants or products. It is therefore of interest to 
study the behaviour of well - documented probes with novel zeolitic materials in order to 
assess whether new topological effects, not previously found in conventional zeolites, can 
be observed. The adsorption strength is strongly dependent on the molecule to pore size 
ratio via the so - called  ‘ conﬁ nement effect . ’  Because in different types of zeolites the OH 
groups, as well as the metals, are located in pores, channels, and cages of different size 
and shape, the  conﬁ nement effect  should be considered when comparing the properties of 
zeolites on the basis of adsorption of probe molecules. Zeolite micropores have also a 
stabilizing effect on the reaction transition states. This stabilization has been demonstrated 
to be of a short - range electrostatic nature and to involve polarization of zeolite oxygen 
atoms, which is of course related to the molecule to pore size ratio. Nevertheless the 
problem of selecting the optimal pore size for a given reaction has no unique solution.

which underline the ability of zeolites to operate selectively under mild, environmentally

 6.1  Introduction 
 Supramolecular chemistry, deﬁ ned by Jean - Marie Lehn as the  ‘ chemistry beyond the 
molecule ’ , is the application of programmed molecules that assemble into larger molecu-
lar architectures via intermolecular non - covalent bonds.  1,2   An important class of supramo-
lecular structures is that of the host – guest assemblies, where the host is a receptor that 
selectively binds (generally smaller) guest molecules.  3 – 5   For some time now, a lot of 
attention has focused on mimicking Nature and controlling non - covalent host – guest 
interactions in synthetic systems, with the aim to arrive at artiﬁ cial supramolecular 
catalysis, i.e. deﬁ ned substrate orientation and pre - activation at an encapsulated catalyti-
cally active centre or in a cavity.  6   It has appeared to be a major challenge to go beyond 
the  ‘ straightforward ’  assembly of appropriate known catalysts, functional groups and 
substrates, e.g. in bioinorganic chemistry, as this in general has so far not resulted in 
catalytic activities or selectivities that can match those displayed by nature ’ s machinery, 
although many an astounding (structural) feat has been accomplished.  7 To fully capture 
all beneﬁ cial aspects displayed by enzymes it should be emphasized that several effects 
contribute to the unique properties exhibited by the (metallo)enzyme active site, such 
as substrate preorganization, restricted substrate motion, protein dynamics, covalent

Molecular Encapsulation
binding of the transition state and desolvation of the substrate,  8   most of which are induced 
by the speciﬁ c micro - environment created inside the enzyme cavity. Especially desolva-
tion, i.e. the exclusion of typical  ‘ organic ’  solvent or aqueous media in which generally 
speaking homogeneous catalysis is taking place, and which tend to heavily inﬂ uence 
chemical reaction, and the substitute governing role taken on by the speciﬁ c micro -
 environment created around the substrates are largely underestimated and two of the 
challenging features of enzyme - mimicking. The conditions created within the micro -
 environment depend on precisely constructed favorable interactions as well as a dissimilar 
dielectric constant. However, such cavity effects are difﬁ cult to study and have mainly 
been put forth on the basis of computational studies. Synthetic approaches to selectively 
assemble such nanosized reaction chambers, i.e. nanoreactors, are therefore highly 
desired, since they would enable experimental veriﬁ cation with synthetic analogues. In 
addition, the ability to control the reaction environment by creating a conﬁ ned and well -
 deﬁ ned nanospace around the substrates could provide new entries and opportunities to 
develop sustainable catalytic processes. 
 6.2  Self - Assembled Nanocapsules 
 Molecular capsules are a special class of host molecules with a very deﬁ ned three -
 dimensional structure, including a hollow interior which under judicious conditions could 
engage in  ‘ binding ’  of guest molecules by encapsulation within the enclosed internal 
space, i.e. the cavity. 9 Besides mere physical entrapment, it can be easily envisioned that 
additional attractive forces, e.g. hydrophobic interactions,   π – π  interactions, or weak 
coordinative interactions can aid in the selective encapsulation of particular guest mole-
cules. Two types of these nanometer - sized molecular capsules can be distinguished; the 
covalent based capsules and the non - covalent based capsules i.e. self - assembled or 
supramolecular capsules.  10 Guest exchange in - and - out of non - covalent capsules can, in 
addition to a gating mechanism, i.e. diffusion of molecules through voids in the supramo-
lecular skeletal construction, proceed via (partial) dissociation of the capsule ( vide infra ). 
Consequently, guest exchange is often, but not always, more facile for non - covalent 
capsules compared to their covalent counterparts. Another advantage of non - covalent 
capsules can be the circumvention of tedious multistep syntheses that are necessary for 
the formation of covalent capsules. In this review we will focus on the chemistry taking 
place inside self - assembled capsules with closed cavities, however, one should keep in 
mind that the boundaries between capsules with open - and closed cavities are not always 
very clear. 
 Since the nineties of the last century, research groups around the world have explored 
the application of nanocapsules as nanoreactors, i.e. reaction vessels for chemical trans-
formations, and the inﬂ uence of different cavity effects.  11,12   In this chapter the focus will 
mainly be on recent developments concerned with synthetic nanoreactors that can be 
obtained in a selective and controlled manner through the use of self - assembly principles 
and rational design, and on their application as catalytically active capsules for respective 
chemical reactions. For the sake of clarity, each speciﬁ c type of nanoreactor will be dis-
cussed in a separate section. Particular types of nanocapsules to be reviewed include 
assemblies held together by hydrogen bonding, metal - ligand interactions and hydrophobic

effects. At the end of the chapter we will shortly address some recent developments in 
the application of micellar and vesicular self - assembled structures. 
 6.3  Encapsulation Effects in Catalysis 
 It is important to realize that the selectivity of a reaction is a matter of relative reaction 
rates between competitive pathways. Also the isolation (or trapping) of otherwise instable 
reaction intermediates by encapsulation and issues such as product inhibition can be 
explained in terms of reaction rates as this is a matter of changing the relative rate of a 
sequence of reaction steps. It is of great relevance to understand how the rate equation 
of a reaction changes when the process takes place inside the capsule. 
 6.3.1  Encapsulation Effects in Terms of Rate Equation 
 In order to understand encapsulation effects of chemical processes, the rate equation 
should be analyzed rather than making a comparison with enzymes. For a simple bimo-
lecular reaction where substrates A and B are giving product C (Equation  6.1 ) the general 
rate equation can be used (Equation  6.2 ). If reactions take place inside a capsule, substrate 
encapsulation and product release in - and - out of the nanoreactor (NR) should be taken 
into account, resulting in a more complex rate equation as all three events have to be 
considered (Equation  6.3 ). In an ideal case where the reaction between A and B inside 
the nanoreactor (NR) is the rate - determining step, the rate equation simpliﬁ es analogously 
to Michaelis – Menten kinetics and depends solely on the rate - constant of this step, i.e.  k b , 
and on the capsule concentration with the encapsulated substrates (NR    ⊃  A  •  B) (Equation 
 6.4 ). 13   In terms of energy proﬁ les these equations can be translated to the energy diagrams 
depicted in Figure  6.1 a.

 The rate - constant  k  is a function of the thermodynamic activation parameters i.e. the 
Gibbs free energy of activation (  ∆ G # ) and hence the activation enthalpy (  ∆ H # ) and the 
activation entropy (  ∆ S # ) via the Eyring and Arrhenius equations:   ∆ G #  =   ∆ H #  –  T  •   ∆ S #  
=  – RT(lnk)  +  c. (T  =  temperature, R  =  gas constant, c  =  a constant). Two extreme sce-
narios can be distinguished when reactions take place inside a capsule (a practical situa-
tion might be a combination of the two): 
  1.     The nanoreactor does not alter the activation parameters (i.e.   ∆
∆
G
G
NR
bulk
#
#
=
) and the 
only effect to be expected is the effect of physically bringing substrates together. In 
essence, the reaction goes from a bimolecular to an intramolecular reaction pathway. 
Since the activation parameters in equations (2) and (4) are the same, the rate constant 
remains the same,  ka  =  kb , and the difference in rate is due to the fact that 
[(NR  ⊃  A  •  B)]  >    [A][B]. In this chapter we have referred to this as  effective concen-
tration . 14   For a reaction that is carried out at a millimolar concentration, the increase 
in reaction rate will be a factor 1000 (using a millimolar capsule), whereas the increase 
in reaction rate at higher concentrations is much smaller. At extremely high substrate 
concentrations (above 1 molar) other issues will become important and the current 
simpliﬁ cation will no longer hold. 
  2.     The nanoreactor does change the activation parameters (i.e.   ∆

). Like 
enzymes, nanoreactors can  stabilize transition states (  ∆ G # ) of the reactions taking 
place in the capsule, which lowers the activation energy barrier (i.e.   ∆

of the reaction, as is depicted in Figure 1a.  15   Besides the obvious enthalpic stabilization 
( ∆ H # ) via non - covalent interactions between the transition state and the surrounding, 
entropy (  ∆ S # ) can also play a key - role in this stabilization. The speciﬁ c size, shape 
and chemical environment of the conﬁ ned nanospace  preorganizes encapsulated sub-
strates  towards the transition state by restricting their translational and rotational 
degrees of freedom and directing their orientation within the enclosed cavity. Generally, 
a precise ﬁ t between the cavity and the substrates results in a more effective preor-
ganization, reducing the potential negative entropy of a reaction. The cavity can also 
activate substrates by forcing them to adopt the most reactive conformation of those 
populated in the bulk, i.e. a statistical effect.  15 
 6.3.2  New Reactivities and Selectivities 
 The speciﬁ c size, shape and hydrophobic environment of the cavity as well as partly 
desolvation and isolation of the substrates from the bulk solvent can induce new activities 
and selectivities. 16 The new microenvironment within the nanoreactor can for example 
enforce the substrates to adopt conformations which are not or less populated in the bulk 
or it can stabilize certain reactive intermediates. In bimolecular reactions the cavity can 
direct the relative spatial orientation of the two substrates, facilitating selective reactions

by e.g. blocking bulk solution pathways that require an orientation which is not possible 
within the cavity.  17   Indeed, manipulation of reaction energetics and environment through 
encapsulation might provide access to reaction pathways which are otherwise inaccessible 
because of their high energy - barrier i.e. the energy landscape within the nanoreactor might 
be different from that outside. The former can be illustrated by considering a kinetic 
controlled reaction between A and B which can give two products: D and E. The speciﬁ c 
interactions between the nanoreactor and the encapsulated substrates can alter the reaction 
activation energy barrier   ∆ G #  of products D and E compared to the bulk. The transition 
state leading to product E can be stabilized upon encapsulation and thereby favouring its 
formation. In contrast, the transition state leading to product D can be destabilized upon 
encapsulation, thereby favouring the formation of product E (Figure  6.1 b). The former 
example describes a situation where the activity and selectivity of a reaction can be 
reversed upon replacing the bulk solvent with a nanoreactor. 
 Substrate size -  and shape - selective reactions can also be explained in terms of effective 
concentration and transition state stabilization. 1) In a mixture of substrates a higher 
concentration can be achieved for those having a complementary size and shape to the 
nanoreactor portals and cavity (and thus can enter the nanoreactor) compared to those 
substrates that can not easily enter or do not ﬁ t within the cavity. In some cases, when 
the substrate encapsulation is a slow process (slow diffusion), substrate encapsulation can 
become the rate - determining step. 2) One can also imagine that substrates of identical 
size and shape can both enter the cavity, but the transition state of one of the reaction 
pathways is stabilized to a greater extent than the other. Importantly, for all encapsulated 
reactions one should keep in mind that the substrate residence time within the nanoreactor 
and the kinetic rates of the encapsulated reaction should at least have a comparable 
magnitude. 18 
 For nanoreactors with an active site such as transition metal species, similar effects as 
described above can be expected.  19 – 21   The rate equation (Equation  6.4 ) is of course dif-
ferent and it might include the catalyst concentration. However, the principles remain the 
same: capsules can bring reactant and catalyst together or the activation parameters can 
be modiﬁ ed. Transition metal - catalyzed reactions consist of several steps, i.e. the catalytic 
cycle, with one of these steps being the rate - determining step. A transition metal - catalyzed 
reaction carried out in a restricted environment could change the rate - determining step of 
the catalytic cycle as a consequence of the change in activation parameters, resulting in 
new selectivities.  22   The cavity can also modify the structure of the encapsulated active 
site, giving rise to inherently different properties.  23,24   Similar to the above discussion, the 
second - coordination - sphere around the active - site can induce substrate size - , shape - , and 
regio - selectivities. Active - site encapsulation can also result in stabilization of the active 
site, which strongly interrelates to preventing catalyst decomposition. For transition metal 
catalysis this stabilization effect might be one of the driving forces towards application. 
 6.3.3  Product Stabilization 
 Nanoreactors might give rise to product inhibition when the nanoreactor has a higher 
afﬁ nity for the product compared to the substrate(s). Inhibiting product release prevents 
a catalytic turnover or at least lowers the reaction rate. In the case of product inhibition, 
the encapsulated product, i.e. (NR    ⊃    C), is very low in energy and the barrier for product

Molecular Encapsulation
release from the nanoreactor cannot be overcome (Figure  6.1 a). This higher preference 
for the product can be enthalpic, e.g. the product has multiple attractive interactions with 
the host. Entropic disadvantages in bimolecular reactions arise from the need to replace 
a single product by two substrates, which can also contribute to product inhibition effects. 
In some cases, product inhibition can be circumvented, for example by implementing a 
follow - up (domino) reaction with the product to yield a compound which exhibits lower 
afﬁ nity for the nanoreactor.  15   Product inhibition is occasionally observed in metallo - cages 
when the product is too large to leave the nanoreactor through its portals. This steric 
barrier can be overcome by using a less constrained, more open shaped nanoreactor or 
by aiming for products that are too small to cause product inhibition.  17 The reverse has 
been shown for H - bonded capsules, where formation of compounds with dimensions 
larger than the  ‘ side - pockets ’  of the capsule enforce a (partial) disrupture or opening of 
the structure to allow for guest exchange.  25   Interestingly, product inhibition can also be 
used for the stabilization of reactive intermediates or labile products that are otherwise 
difﬁ cult to isolate and analyse.  26   The stabilization of reactive intermediates can provide 
new information on mechanism of the particular chemical reaction. 
 6.4  Hydrogen Bonded Capsules 
 Hydrogen bonds can be typiﬁ ed as weak, non - covalent interactions that are highly 
directional and dynamic, all of which make them ideally suited as a motif for the con-
struction of supramolecular capsules. If properly designed, and even when using a non - 
stoichiometric mixture, solvation of the respective building blocks will lead to the spon-
taneous and instantaneous formation of such hydrogen bonded assemblies, albeit in a 
dynamic fashion, displaying fairly high rates of dissociation and recombination compared 
to e.g. coordinative interactions. As a result of this, and dependent on the speciﬁ c multi-
plicity of the H - bonding motifs present in the supramolecular system, the lifetime of the 
resulting capsules can range from microseconds to hours.  27 – 29   Capsule assembly is induced 
by encapsulation of appropriate guests (templating agent), which can be solvent molecules 
or speciﬁ c guests. Rebek and co - workers have shown that optimal guest occupation is 
approx. 55% of the available volume of the cavity.  30 However, stable self - assembled 
capsules with guests that occupy much more or less than 55% of the volume exist as well. 
Most H - bonded capsules do not have sizeable apertures for guest exchange and conse-
quently guest exchange occurs via partial or complete rupture of the capsule structure, 
depending on the properties of the host, guest and solvent. The residence time of the guest 
within the capsule is in the order of milliseconds to hours. H - bonded capsules are stable 
in apolar organic solvents such as dichloromethane and mesitylene while competitive 
solvents like DMSO and water lead to capsule dissociation. 
 Rebek and co - workers have developed the cylinder - shaped capsule  A . 27 – 29 This capsule 
consists of two self - complementary vase - shaped cavitands, i.e. resorcinarenes, substituted 
with four imide - functionalities on their upper rim (Figure  6.2 a). The cavitands dimerize 
in solution into the cylindrical capsule  A upon the formation of a seam of eight bifurcated 
hydrogen bonds (i.e. sixteen H - bonds). Capsule  A  has a cylindrical cavity with an internal 
volume of  ca . 425  Å 3 . The cavity contains a gradient of polarity and shape along its length 
and accommodates elongated guests. The capsule can simultaneously encapsulate two

different guests, i.e. selective pairwise recognition, such as one molecule of benzene 
together with one  p  - xylene molecule, which can be of interest for coupling reactions. 
During guest exchange two ﬂ aps of the capsule open, allowing guest exchange without 
capsule dissociation. 
 6.4.1  Stoichiometric 1,3 - Dipolar Cycloaddition 
 Rebek and co - workers have applied the cylindrical capsule  A  as a nanoreactor for the 
1,3 - dipolar cycloaddition between phenylazide  1  and phenylacetylene  2 (Scheme  6.1 ). 31 
Nanoreactor  A  simultaneously encapsulates reagents  1  and  2  to give [ A  ⊃  1  •  2 ] (this 
notation denotes that  A  encapsulates  1  and  2 ) next to the homo combinations [ A  ⊃  12 ] 
and [ A  ⊃  22 ] which are formed slightly less than the statistical distribution would predict. 
It was already shown that the cylindrical cavity of  A constrains the orientation of the 
guest molecules in an edge - to - edge fashion, so that their substituents are forced to interact. 
The cycloaddition within nanoreactor  A  results exclusively in the 1,4 - triazole after several 
days at millimolar concentrations. In contrast, the reaction in the absence of  A produces 
a 1   :   1 mixture of regioisomeric products of 1,4 -  and 1,5 - triazoles and has a half - life of 
several years. The observed rate enhancement is explained by an effective concentration 
of 3.7 M within  A . The high regioselectivity results from preorganized orientation of the 
substrates within  A , imposed by the nanoreactor boundaries. Nanoreactor  A  has also been 
shown to impose substrate size selectivity; the encapsulated cycloaddition between the 
larger azides 1 - naphthyl azide or 4 - biphenyl azide and phenylacetylene was not acceler-
ated. The system suffers, as expected, from product inhibition and therefore stoichiomet-
ric amounts of  A  have to be used. The product could be liberated upon addition of DMF 
resulting in denaturation of the capsule. 
 The  ‘ softball ’  capsule  B  (Figure  6.2 b), also developed by Rebek and co - workers, is 
composed of two multi - ring structures having a bridged bicyclic centrepiece and two 
glycoluril units on both ends of the multi - ring, providing proper rigidity, curvature and 
functional groups necessary for capsule assembly (Figure  6.2 b).  27 – 29 The self - complemen-
tary glycoluril - based building blocks dimerize in solution into capsule  B  due to the forma-
tion of a seam of sixteen hydrogen bonds.  ‘ Softball ’  B  is a closed - shell capsule of roughly

spherical shape with an internal volume of  ca . 400  Å 3 . The  ‘ softball ’  can simultaneously 
encapsulate two different guests such as one molecule of deuterated benzene together 
with one molecule of deuterated monoﬂ uorobenzene. Guests encapsulation occurs by 
opening of two separate ﬂ aps of the  ‘ softball ’  and subsequently departure of the guest as 
the incoming guest approaches, i.e. a gating mechanism. 
 6.4.2  Catalytic Diels – Alder Reaction 
 Rebek and co - workers have used  ‘ softball ’  B  as a nanoreactor for bimolecular Diels –
 Alder reactions. 25 The Diels – Alder reaction between  p - benzoquinone ( 3 ) and cyclohexa-
diene  4a  within nanoreactor  B , present in stoichiometric amounts, has been accelerated 
170 - fold compared to the bulk and resulted in the encapsulated adduct [ B  ⊃  5a ] (Scheme 
 6.2 a). Even though nanoreactor  B enhances the rate of the encapsulated reaction, no true 
catalytic behaviour was observed because of product inhibition by  5a . After encapsulating 
two quinones  3 within  B , one molecule is occasionally replaced by a thiophene dioxide 
 4b , which leads to the encapsulated Diels – Alder product  5b . Product inhibition is partly 
suppressed if thiophene dioxide derivative  4b  is used as the diene (Scheme  6.2 b). This is 
because two molecules of the  p - benzoquinone ( 3 ), i.e. [ B  ⊃  ( 3 ) 2 ] have a higher afﬁ nity 
for nanoreactor  B  than derivative  5b , the corresponding Diels – Alder product of the thi-
ophene dioxide. After each turnover the encapsulated product is released and replaced by 
two quinone reactants and true catalysis can take place. When catalytic amounts of  B (10 
mol%) are used, a tenfold rate enhancement (at 10 mM substrate concentration) compared 
to the background reaction was observed, which is still lower than can be expected on 
the basis of the effective concentration.     
 6.5  Capsules Based on Metal – Ligand Interactions 
 Metal – ligand interactions are strong and highly directional and lead to the self - assembly 
of robust stable coordination cages.  32 Kinetically labile metal - ligand (M – L) interactions

are essential for converting initially formed kinetic products to the more stable thermo-
dynamic product. Therefore appropriate conditions should be applied for the assembly of 
M – L based capsules in high yields. The metal coordination geometry in combination with 
multidentate organic ligands are used as codons for curvature. The preorganized and rigid 
nature of the ligands results in stable and well deﬁ ned capsules with cage - like architec-
tures. Unlike H - bonded capsules, guest exchange in and out of the coordination cages 
occurs by expansion of the cage apertures without M – L bond rupture.  33 Consequently, 
the size and shape of the cage apertures function as a gate keeper as they dictate the 
permitted size and shape of the guests. Besides the encapsulation of substrate molecules 
to facilitate certain conversions, also catalytically active metal centres can thus be encap-
sulated. Indeed sufﬁ cient space should be available to allow the transformation of encap-
sulated substrates at the active site.  
 6.6  Tetrahedral Cages Based on Octahedral M 3+ Ions 
 Raymond and co - workers have developed the chiral tetrahedral [M 4 L 6 ] 12 −  coordination 
cage  C  consisting of four metal ions with an octahedral coordination geometry, e.g. Ga 3+ , 
and six naphthalene - based bis - bidentate catechol amide ligands (Figure  6.3 ). 19 
 The metal ions are situated at the corners of the tetrahedron and the ligands span the 
edges of the tetrahedron. The tris - bidentate chelation of the metal atoms renders them 
chiral (  ∆  or   Λ ), and the mechanical coupling between the metals through the rigid ligands 
results in the exclusive formation of the homochiral assemblies   ∆ , ∆ , ∆ , ∆  and   Λ , Λ , Λ , Λ . 
Resolution of both enantiomers by means of selective precipitation upon association with 
the chiral cation  S - nicotinium was recently described. 34 The desired M 4 L 6 stoichiometry 
with a tetrahedral shaped cage is achieved by the presence of an appropriate guest

template during the assembly process such as   NR4
+ (R   =   Me, Et, Pr). The highly negatively 
charged tetrahedral cage is soluble in water and other polar solvents and contains a hydro-
phobic cavity of  ∼ 300 – 500  Å 3 . The highly anionic character of the cage allows for exclu-
sive encapsulation of monocationic guests such as alkylammonium ions and cationic 
organometallic complexes such as [CpRu(C 6 H 6 )]  +  (Cp  =   η 5 - C 5 H 5 ). Recently, tetrahedral 
nanocages with even larger interior voids have been assembled by the group of Raymond, 
through modiﬁ cation of the ligand backbone, using binaphthyl as the central framework 
instead of the formerly employed mononaphthyl skeleton. Calculated inner volumes in 
excess of  ∼ 700  Å 3  were reported, leading to favourable encapsulation of guests such as 
tetraphenylphosphonium ions.  35 
 6.6.1  Hydrolysis 
 The tetrahedral coordination cage  C  has been used by Raymond, Bergman and co - workers 
as a catalyst for the acidic hydrolysis of orthoformates in basic solutions.  36 This is an 
example where the inner phase facilitates reactions that are not possible in the exterior 
environment. Nanoreactor  C  has a much higher afﬁ nity for monocationic guests over 
neutral guests. Addition of neutral and even weakly basic compounds such as amines, 
phosphines and orthoformates, HC(OR) 3 , to aqueous solutions of  C  resulted in encapsula-
tion of their protonated form. The protonation is thermodynamically driven by stabiliza-
tion of the protonated species. Hydrolysis of orthoformates involves a protonated 
intermediate. Indeed catalytic amounts of  C  (1 mol %) in basic solution (pH 11) gave 
rapid hydrolysis of orthoformates to the corresponding formate esters, HC(O)(OR), which 
is subsequently hydrolyzed by OH  −   to formate,   HCO2
− (Scheme  6.3 a). Product inhibition 
is not taking place and the empty nanoreactor  C  can re - enter the catalytic cycle like a 
true catalyst. Rate accelerations of up to 890 - fold were observed for tris(isopropyl)ortho-
formate. As expected, nanoreactor  C  exhibits substrate size selectivity and only orthofor-
mates smaller than tripentyl orthoformate are readily hydrolyzed.

Chemistry in Self-Assembled Nanoreactors 
155
 A mechanistic study of the catalytic reaction has revealed a catalytic cycle in which 
the neutral orthoformate is ﬁ rst encapsulated within nanoreactor  C (Scheme  6.3 b). 
Protonation of the encapsulated substrate, presumably by deprotonation of water, results 
in the stabilized monoprotonated orthoformate. Subsequently, two successive hydrolysis 
steps within  C  liberate two equivalents of the corresponding alcohol. Finally, the proto-
nated formate ester is ejected from  C  and is further hydrolyzed by OH  −   in solution. The 
shift in the effective basicity of the encapsulated guests compared to the free analogue is 
four orders of magnitude, typically also found for enzymes that modify basic properties 
of the encapsulated substrates. This example is clearly based on stabilization of the transi-
tion state by interactions between the capsule and the encapsulated transition state. The 
mechanism of the encapsulated reaction involves an initial pre - equilibrium step followed 
by a ﬁ rst - order rate - limiting step. This Michaelis – Menten kinetics is parallel to enzymatic 
pathways. An inhibition study with   NPr4
+, a strongly interacting but reversible guest 
for  C , has revealed that the encapsulated hydrolysis reaction exhibits competitive 
inhibition. 
 The unimolecular Aza - Cope rearrangement of ally  15,19 and propargyl 37 enammonium 
cations within nanoreactor  C was also investigated by Raymond, Bergman and co -
 workers. The former reaction was catalyzed by 13 mol % of  C  and a rate acceleration of 
up to 850 - fold was observed, whilst with propargyl enammonium cations, the substoi-
chiometric [3,3] - sigmatropic rearrangement was found to be enhanced up to a factor of 
184 in the presence of nanocage  C . Since this is an intramolecular reaction, it represents

Molecular Encapsulation
a clear - cut example in which the capsule preorganizes the substrate to reduce the entropic 
contributions to the activation energy. The nanoreactor induces substrate size -  and shape -
 selectivity and acts as a true catalyst, since release and hydrolysis of the iminium product 
circumvent product inhibition. 
 Raymond and co - workers have encapsulated cationic transition metal complexes such 
as [Cp * (PMe 3 )Ir(Me)(C 2 H 4 )] +  and [(PMe 3 ) 2 Rh(COD)] +  within their tetrahedral coordina-
tion cage  C via non - directional, non - covalent bonds (Figure  6.4 ). 38,39 Concerning the 
former, the group of Raymond in conjunction with Bergman and co - workers have studied 
the thermal C – H bond activation of aldehydes and ethers by an Ir(III) - complex encapsu-
lated within nanoreactor  C . This encapsulated iridium complex [ C  ⊃  Ir - complex] induced 
highly speciﬁ c substrate size and shape selectivities. However, product inhibition has 
prevented this system to achieve catalytic turnover.  19,38 
 6.6.2  Allylic Alcohol Isomerization 
 More success was garnered when the cationic rhodium complex [(PMe 3 ) 2 Rh(COD)] + , 
encapsulated within the tetrahedral coordination cage  C , was used as an isomerization 
catalyst for allylic alcohols (Table  6.1 ).  39   The size selection by nanoreactor  C only 
allowed encapsulation of the catalyst precursor [(PMe 3 ) 2 Rh(COD)] +  and not the PEt 3 -
 equivalent. The encapsulated precursor was hydrogenated to give the encapsulated active 
catalyst [  C ⊃(

2], i.e. [ C  ⊃  6 ], which remained encapsulated for 12 h. 
[ C  ⊃  6 ] is not the thermodynamic product as longer reaction times result in release of  6 
from the capsule. Therefore, the application of [ C  ⊃  6 ] is restricted to fast reactions such 
as allylic alcohol isomerisation, where substrate entrance and product release are rapid 
and occur prior to active site release. In contrast to the non - encapsulated catalyst  6 , the 
encapsulated catalyst [ C  ⊃  6 ] only isomerized small allyl alcohols (Table  6.1 , entries 
1b – 3b). Encapsulation within nanoreactor  C  imposes two - fold substrate selectivity, i.e. 
size -  and shape - selectivity, to the active site. The origin of this dual - selectivity lies in the 
 Figure 6.4   Cationic Ir - complex encapsulated within  C , i.e. [ C  ⊃  Ir + - complex] (this 
notation denotes that C encapsulates an Ir + - complex).   [6]  Reproduced by permission of

deﬁ ned apertures of the cage, which inhibit inclusion of larger branched substrates. 
Terminal substituted crotyl alcohol inhibits the catalyst (Table  6.1 , entry 4a), as is con-
ﬁ rmed by the simultaneous addition of both allyl alcohol and crotyl alcohol to the non -
 encapsulated catalyst  6 , which did not result in isomerization of either substrate. However, 
addition of both allyl alcohol and crotyl alcohol to [ C  ⊃  6 ] led to selective isomerization 
of the allyl alcohol. Hence, nanoreactor  C  protects the encapsulated catalyst  6 against 
decomposition and poisoning of the complex. 
 Using a slightly different approach, Hupp and co - workers have described the assembly 
of an open box structure, encapsulating a Mn(III) - porphyrin via direct metal - ligand inter-
actions between the guest molecule and the host structure.  20   The open box is based on 
four Zn(II) - porphyrins coordinated to four [Re(CO) 3 Cl] complexes via their pyridyl 
ligands. The encapsulated Mn(III) - porphyrin appeared to be a stable and selective epoxi-
dation catalyst. Although the open box type assemblies are somewhat beyond the scope 
of this chapter, it is important to realize that these more open assemblies can also provide 
interesting catalysts. 
 6.7  Octahedral and Square Pyramidal Cages Based on 
Square - Planar M 2+ Ions 
 Upon mixing suitably  cis - protected square planar Pd 2+  or Pt 2+  complexes, e.g. [Pd(en)] 2+ 
(en   =   ethylenediamine) together with planar C3 - symmetric, triangular and tripodal ligands 
such as 2,4,6 - tris(4 - pyridyl) - 1,3,5 - triazine ligand in a 6   :   4 relative stoichiometry, sponta-
neous self - assembly results in the formation of octahedral nanocage  D , as described by
