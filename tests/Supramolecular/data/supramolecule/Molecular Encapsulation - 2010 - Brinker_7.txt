Organic Cations in 
Constrained Systems

 12.1  Introduction 
 There is growing interest in artiﬁ cial receptors that serve as sensors of charged species. 
Studies of the interaction between hosts and organic cations can also advance our under-
standing of the recognition properties of biological systems. Because many bioactive 
molecules such as the neurotransmitters acetylcholine, serotonin, nicotine, or protonated 
 γ  - aminobutyric acid are ammonium ions, the complexation of these organic cations is of 
particular interest. Aliphatic biogenic amines are being monitored in several foodstuffs 
like ﬁ sh, meat cheese and wine during ageing and storage. 1 
 The design of selectively bound host – guest complexes is a challenge for supramolecu-
lar chemistry. This chapter deals with host – guest systems including cyclophanes, calix-
arenes, homocalixarenes, and cucurbiturils as hosts. Such molecular containers (cavitands) 
should provide a cavity surrounded by rigid walls that enables close proximity of the 
guest to the wall of the host. In order to take advantage of cation – π  interactions, aromatic 
subunits are necessary. The inﬂ uences of shape, rigidity, and the chemical structure of 
the host molecules as well as the nature of the organic cations will be reviewed. More 
complex systems such as sensors and switchable host – guest complexes are applications 
which will play a pronounced role in the development of new receptors developed from 
base structures of the hosts.

 12.1.1  Hosts 
 For binding to occur, a host must possess suitable binding sites with favourable electronic 
properties such as polarity and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor abilities that complement 
those of the guest. Cyclophanes such as  I , calixarenes  II , homocalixarenes  III , and resor-
cinarenes  IV fulﬁ l these requirements (Scheme  12.1 ). Cucurbiturils  V  are water soluble 
container molecules without aromatic subunits. Therefore, both electrostatic interaction 
other than cation – π interaction and hydrophobic interaction play a dominant role. 
 The host molecules considered here possess a more or less rigid structure surrounding 
a cavity that can form complexes with organic cations having various shapes. The strength 
of binding depends on several parameters such as: 
 •  The type of interaction between host and guest. 
 •  The solvent used. 
 •  The rigidity of the host. 
 •  The anion. 
 1.  While cation – π interaction 2   plays an important role not only in biological systems as 
illustrated by acetylcholine esterase,  3 artiﬁ cial receptors with sidewalls containing 
aromatic groups also exhibit this type of interaction with organic cations. Hydrogen 
bonds ( + N − H  …  X) between the guest ammonium ions, formed by protonation of 
amines, and the functional groups (X   =   O, N) of the host molecule may be stronger 
than other electrostatic forces such as cationic – π interaction.

 Charged groups such as sulfanyl substituents may serve as secondary binding sites 
operating through salt bridges. 
 2.  The solvent strongly inﬂ uences the complexation of organic cations. The more fully 
the cations are solvated, the lower will be the free energy gained by the interaction 
between the host and the organic cation. Cationic – π  interaction has the greatest inﬂ u-
ence in low polarity solvents such as chloroform. In more polar solvents, such as 
acetonitrile, cation – π  interactions are distinctly diminished as compared with chloro-
form or tetrachloroethane. Above all, hydrophobic interactions play the main role in 
aqueous solution. Furthermore, CH – π  interaction may contribute to the overall binding 
strength. 
  3.     To bind guests effectively, a host must have binding sites which are complementary 
to the properties of the guest molecule. The electronic character of the host must match 
that of the guest. The conformation of the host must supply strong interactions at the 
proper distances and angles. If a host does not undergo a signiﬁ cant conformational 
change upon complexation, it is preorganized. On the other hand, a high ﬂ exibility of 
the host consumes energy which is then not available for the binding process. The 
overall free energy of complexation represents the difference between the unfavourable 
reorganisation energy and the favourable binding energy. However, strongly preorgan-
ized hosts may hinder the formation of the complexation transition state leading to 
slower guest binding kinetics (slow exchange results). In contrast, conformationally 
ﬂ exible hosts are able to adjust rapidly to complexation conditions, and both compl-
exation and decomplexation are rapid (fast exchange). 
  4.     Because ion pairs are formed in low polarity aprotic solvents, the anion of organic 
cations also contributes to the complexation. It has been found that the stability of 
complexes between aromatic receptors and ammonium and iminium ions is decreased 
in the order picrate > triﬂ uoroacetate > I  −  > Br  −  > Cl  −  > tosylate > acetate. 4   Thus, the lower the 
cation - anion attraction, the stronger is the cation – π interaction. 5 
 Hosts must provide not only a sufﬁ cient interior concave surface, but also an opening 
for accepting the guest. A large opening leads to a rapid in - out exchange and consequently 
to small binding constants. A small opening may not provide a portal large enough for 
the guest molecules to enter. Accordingly, gated (constrictive binding) and non - gated 
hosts may result. 6 
 12.1.2  Guests 
 The organic cations of the types  A  –  D are considered in this chapter (Scheme  12.2 ). 
 Both the charge density and the shape of the cation will mainly govern the interaction 
with the  π  - basic cavity of the hosts of types  I  –  IV  (Scheme  12.1 ). The accessibility of 
the cavity of a particular host is controlled both by the size of the cavity and by the con-
formational mobility of the host. 
 Ammonium ions  A  represent a special guest class because the cation can be formed 
by proton transfer in acidic solutions or by acidic functionalities such as the OH - groups 
of the calixarenes. The N + H - bond allows formation of ionic hydrogen bonds with H - bond 
acceptors such as oxygen (e.g., at the narrower rim of calixarenes  II  or at the wider rim 
of resorcinarenes  IV ). In spherical tetraalkylammonium ions  B , the positive charge is 
dispersed over the four alkyl groups. In contrast, the positive charge is non - symmetrically

distributed in the ﬂ at aromatic iminium ions of the type  C . The charge of aryltropylium 
ions  D  (R   =   Ar) is strongly delocalized between the tropylium moiety and the aryl sub-
stituent. Therefore, the question arises as to whether both parts of these guests are able 
to orient toward the interior. Additionally, both  C  and  D  may interact with aromatic units 
of the hosts by  π - stacking. 
 12.1.3  Structure – Interaction Relationships 
 The quality of synthetic receptors toward binding of organic cations may be evaluated by 
thermodynamic parameters such as binding constants, enthalpy (  ∆ H), entropy (  ∆ S) and 
Gibbs free energy (  ∆ G) and also by structural parameters like complexation - induced shifts 
of proton resonances (CIS) as determined from NMR - spectroscopy and crystal structures. 
Determination of binding constants and binding energies can be determined with spec-
troscopic methods (UV - Vis - , NMR, and Mass spectroscopy). In most cases, K is deter-
mined with titration experiments followed by regression plot analysis of the observed 
data based on suitable equations.  7   UV - Vis and NMR spectroscopy are complementary 
methods, functioning in different concentration ranges. 
 Compared with spectroscopic techniques, calorimetry is a universal methodology; it 
functions independently of probe peculiarities, and has the advantage of yielding enthalpy 
as a directly observable experimental result.  8   Depending on the extent of interaction 
between the components from a single calorimetric experiment, the main state functions 
of the binding process (  ∆ H,   ∆ S and   ∆ G) are accessible. Because in most cases the com-
plete set of parameters is not available, different hosts related to the binding strength and 
selectivity of various guests may be compared on the basis of binding constants. The CIS 
values taken from  1 H NMR titration experiments provide valuable information about the 
arrangement of the guest within the host. Protons deep inside the cavity of the host often 
are strongly shifted up - ﬁ eld due to the shielding effect of the aromatic sidewalls. All 
methods mentioned above also provide the stoichiometry of complexes. 
 12.2  Host – guest Complexes with Organic Cations 
 12.2.1  Cyclophanes 
 The host  I - 1  (Scheme  12.3 ) possesses an opening that allows guests such as acetylcholine 
variants  B - 1  and  B - 2  to enter the hydrophobic cavity. The receptor has a high afﬁ nity for 
these ammonium ions (  ∆ G  =  − 5.3 and  − 5.2  kcal  mol  − 1 , respectively) in aqueous solution. 
Probably hydrophobic interactions play the main role. Small changes in the size of the 
host cavity signiﬁ cantly affect host – guest interaction. 9   CIS values revealed that a loose 
association is required to achieve a strong binding of quaternary ammonium ions.

 The cyclophanes  I - 2 – I - 4 (Scheme  12.4 ) were synthesized to improve the afﬁ nity for 
protonated amines.  10   While tetraalkylated ammonium ions are strongly complexed by  I - 2 , 
unmodiﬁ ed protonated amines are not well bound. Simple protonated amines are more 
strongly solvated by water than alkylated ammonium ions.  10   Through the combination of 
interactions between host and guest, including cation – π , hydrophobic, and salt bridge 
interactions, the host  I - 4  (Scheme  12.4 ) can bind even well - solvated guests such as  A - 1 
 –  A3 ,  B - 3 – B - 5 , and  C - 1 ,  C - 2 . Only the binding of  B - 6  is not improved by salt bridge 
formation. Arginine - NH 2 ( A - 3 ) and arginine - containing dipeptides were strongly bound

in water solution ( ∆ G  =  − 6  kcal  mol  − 1 ). The effect of salt bridges in addition to cation – π 
interactions can be estimated as  ∼ 1  kcal  mol  − 1 . The ﬂ at, delocalized   π systems such as in 
 A - 3  and  C - 1  are well suited for stacking of aromatics of  I - 4 . Furthermore, the cation must 
have a region of intense positive electrostatic potential for an electrostatic interaction to 
occur with the carboxylate groups in an exposed aqueous environment. 
 12.2.2  Calix[n]arenes 
 The calix[n]arenes, perhaps the major class of organic receptors in supramolecular chem-
istry, are simple to synthesize and can be widely modiﬁ ed by substitutions at the aromatic 
cores and the phenolic OH - groups. Therefore, they can easily be adapted for speciﬁ c 
uses. 11 – 15   The vase - like conformation of calix[4] and, to a greater extent, the higher homo-
logues calix[5], calix[6], or calix[8]arene is characterized by a high mobility due to ﬂ ip-
ping of the aromatic units. However, the mobility of the calix[4] and calix[5]arenes in 
particular can be restricted by substituents at the narrower rim of the cone conformation 
(Scheme  12.5 ). Other conformations, such as the 1,3 - alternate arrangement of the aryl 
groups, do not play a signiﬁ cant role in binding of organic cations. 
 Calixarenes without ionisable substituents at the wider rim are not water soluble. Their 
complexation behaviour towards organic cations, has, therefore, been studied mainly in 
lipophilic solvents such as CDCl 3  and (CDCl 2 ) 2 . The cation – π  interaction is the main 
contribution to the stability of complexes and the association constants are rather low, 
ranging from 10 to 1000  M  − 1 (see Table  12.1 ). 
 The role of the cavity size of calixarenes is heavily predictable. For example, there is 
no signiﬁ cant hole - selectivity of hosts  II - 1 – II - 3  (Scheme  12.6 ) in complexes both with 
the tetraalkylammonium ion  B - 7  and the iminium ion  C - 3  (Table  12.1 ). Surprisingly, the 
ﬂ exible methylether  II - 1 , which exhibits interconversion between different conformers 
(cone - partial cone, 1,3 alternate), binds  B - 7  whilst the ﬁ xed cone with propyl groups at 
the narrower rim does not. 16 Also, the different cavity sizes of the calix[4]arene  II - 4 and 
calix[5]arene  II - 5 ﬁ xed in their cone - conformation exhibit no selectivity with the iminium

guest (compare Table  12.1 , entries 4 and 5, row  C - 4 ). In contrast, by restricting the acces-
sibility of the cavity by a bridge such as in host  II - 7  (Scheme  12.6 ) only monomethylam-
monium ion and not the larger di - , tri -  and tetramethylammonium ions are bound.  17 
Substituents at the wider rim generally have a considerable inﬂ uence on the binding of 
organic cations. The simplest and most often found inﬂ uence is the size of substituents 
which hinder guest binding due to steric interference. The bulky  tert - butyl groups used 
in the synthesis of calixarenes diminish the association constants (compare entries 5 and 
6 of Table  12.1 ). On the other hand, substituents may enlarge the cavity, thus supporting

 Scheme 12.7   CIS values (in Hz) observed for different protons in the complex  II - 8 / D - 2 18 
binding. The cycloheptatrienyl substituents of host  II - 8 (Scheme  12.6 and Table  12.1 ) 
seem to support the binding of ﬂ at iminium and aryl tropylium ions but hinder the com-
plexation of spherical ammonium ions (see Table  12.1 , entry 7). The conformation of 
host  II - 8  exhibits a ﬂ attened cone - conformation (see crystal structure in Scheme  12.6 ) 
which is suitable in order to bind ﬂ at aryltropylium ions. According to the CIS values of 
different protons in both the host and the guest, the guest is sandwiched between two 
cycloheptatrienyl substituents of the host. The tropylium moiety is closely bound to the 
cavity, whereas the aryl group is pointed towards the exterior (see Scheme  12.7 ).  18 A 
comparison of the CIS values (Hz) observed for the cycloheptatrienyl substituents with 
those of the protons of the aromatic rings indicates that the cationic guest is located in 
the upper part of the calixarene cavity. Free horizontal rotation of the aryltropylium ion 
is slow on the NMR time scale.   
 The cone conformation of tetraalkoxy calix[4]arenes is not completely blocked in solu-
tion but experiences residual mobility between two C 2v (ﬂ attened cone) structures.  19 The 
residual mobility can be diminished by functionalization at the narrower rim such as the 
introduction of crown bridges.  19   Also the alkylation of only two OH - groups at the nar-
rower rim seems to immobilize the cone conformation due to hydrogen bonds. Accordingly, 
tetraalkoxy derivatives of the host  II - 8  exhibit no or very low binding properties towards 
ammonium and iminium ions.  18   However, a particularly high association constant of 
K  =  3526 l  mol  − 1  was measured for the complex of the host  II - 9 (Scheme  12.6 ) with 
tetramethylammonium chloride. 20 The anion was proposed to act as a hydrogen bonding 
acceptor towards the phenolic OH - group of the substituents.

environment where most biological processes occur.  22  para - Sulfonated - calix[4]arene  II -
 10  is cone shaped with hydrophilic wide and narrow rims separated by a hydrophobic 
region. This compound binds the basic amino acids lysine and arginine with association 
constants of  ∼ 10 3  M  − 1  at pH 8.  23 Compounds  II - 11  and  II - 12 , in contrast, form only weak 
complexes. Acetylcholine  B - 2 formed very stable complexes with association constants 
of up to 4  ×  10 5 l  mol  − 1 with  II - 10 . 24 Notably, this afﬁ nity constant is comparable to the 
values observed for natural biological receptors. 
 A microcalorimetry study of the complexation of  II - 10  showed that the mobile host is 
able to bind tetraalkylammonium and alkylammonium ions in water with association 
constants up to 47000   M  − 1 . 25   The binding of all organic cations is enthalpy driven, but the 
role of hydrophobic interaction is difﬁ cult to evaluate. The entropic term is small and 
positive (except for the tetraethylammonium ion) and does not correspond to the expecta-
tions of the classical hydrophobic effect. But recent studies have indicated that the  ‘ non-
classical ’  hydrophobic effect is controlled by the enthalpy.  26   The positive sign of the 
entropic term indicates that the solvation of the alkyl chain plays a role. In comparison 
to  II - 10 , the host  II - 13 , locked in the cone conformation, binds the tetraethylammonium 
ion with an afﬁ nity that is one order of magnitude weaker (3160  vs . 25100 l  mol  − 1 ). 27 The 
binding is assisted by the charged sulfanyl groups at the wider rim. The host  II - 14 , which 
lacks these charged groups, forms a complex with the tetraethylammonium ion with an 
association constant of only 126 l   mol  − 1 . The ditopic guest  B - 9  (Scheme  12.6 ) is selec-
tively complexed with the aromatic ring pointing toward the interior of the cavity while 
the  II - 14  variant is able to recognise only the polar alkylammonium head group of  B - 9 
(Scheme  12.9 ). The complex geometry was discerned from the CIS values observed for 
protons of the aromatic ring and the protons of the methyl groups,  28   and indicates the

relative importance of electrostatic cation – π  interaction. For both guests, the inclusion 
process is enthalpy driven, but is entropically disfavoured. The negative entropic term 
results from a favourable term due to the desolvation of host and guest upon complexation 
and the unfavourable term is due to increased rigidity of the system upon inclusion of the 
guest. The higher stability of the hosts bearing the sulfonyl groups results from a greater 
desolvation of the host – guest complex. Surprisingly, the receptor  II - 10  is more efﬁ cient 
than the rigidiﬁ ed hosts, which may be explained by the assumption that the host is more 
adaptable to the shape of the guest due to its conformational mobility.   
 The calix[4]arenes  II - 15  and  II - 16  (Scheme  12.10 ) are only soluble in lipophilic media 
such as chloroform. Accordingly, the cation – π  interaction is expected to mainly control 
the strength of complexation of acetylcholine iodide  B - 2 , chinolinium perchlorate  C - 2 , 
and the tropylium hexaﬂ uorophosphates  D - 3  and  D - 4 (Scheme  12.10 ). Association con-
stants determined with the help of NMR titration have revealed that the charged host  II - 16 
binds organic cations more tightly than does the neutral host  II - 15  (compare column 3 in 
Table  12.2 ). 29   This outcome is surprising and probably the result of complementary 
cation – π  interaction, charge transfer interaction, and   π - stacking. 29   If the cationic host  II -
 16  binds organic cations, the question arises as to whether the cationic host interacts with 
itself. Dimers have been formed with an association constant of 230   M  − 1 (Scheme  12.11 ), 
which demonstrates that the attractive cation – π  interaction between each of the tropylium 
groups with the  π  - basic walls of the calixarene cavity is stronger than the repulsive inter-
action between the two positive charges. 
 Other calix[4]arenes combine both a host and a guest unit, such as the pyridinium -
 conjugated derivative  II - 17  (Scheme  12.12 ) which forms oligomers by cation – π interac-
tion both in solution, in the solid state, and also in the gas phase, as revealed by  1 H NMR 
spectroscopy, crystal structure determination, and crystallographic studies. 30 
 A general problem in the determination of association constants with the help of 
NMR titration appeared for the complexes  II - 16 / B - 2  and  II - 16 / D - 3 (Table  12.2 ). 
Different association constants were obtained by using signals from different protons 
(e.g., protons of the tropylium moiety and the dimethylamino group of guest  D - 3 ). 
This ﬁ nding can be interpreted as the formation of isomeric complexes in which dif-
ferent parts of the guest molecule are oriented into the interior of the host molecule 
(see Scheme  12.13 ). In such cases, the determination of the microscopic association 
constants of both complexes is not possible. Obviously the formation of isomeric

the absence of solvents, the selectivity of binding can be expected to be different from 
those observed in solution. 
 12.2.4  Homooxacalixarenes 
 The introduction of an additional atom such as oxygen into the methylene bridges has 
two effects: 1) The variety of cyclophanes is considerably increased (two examples are 
shown in Scheme  12.14 ). 2) Depending on the number and the distribution of the bridging 
oxygens, the variety of isomers and conformers is strongly increased. 3) The size of the 
cavity can be increased relative to the calix[4]arenes; enlarging the cavity may improve 
the binding strength. 4) The mobility of the cyclophanes is considerably increased. 32 Two 
effects may result  –  the higher mobility expends energy and the binding energy is dimin-
ished or the higher mobility enables the cyclophane to form the most suitable geometry 
of the host in the complex. 
 The whole set of compounds methylated at the narrower rim  III - 1 – III - 7 (Scheme 
 12.14 ) has been synthesized and the binding of picrates of organic cations  B - 2 ,  B - 10 
B - 11and  C - 3 (Scheme  12.6 , Scheme  12.14 ) was studied. 33 Despite having the same 
macrocyclic structure of the hosts, there are remarkable differences in both the measured 
association constants with different guests (see Table  12.3 ) and the CIS values extrapo-
lated to indicate complete complexation of the guest. These results indicate that the 
cavity must be somewhat differently arranged in the complexes with different cations 
due to the balance between cation – π  interaction and the strain energy of the host.

However, the differences in host geometry are much smaller in complexes than in free 
hosts. 33,34 
 If one assume that similar changes in solvation and in cation - anion attraction occur 
through complexation of a given guest by  III - 1 – III - 7 , then the association constants 
reﬂ ect the contributions of the reorganisation energy of the mobile host and the cation – π 
interactions. The hydrogen bonds at the narrower rim, and therefore both the position and 
the number of OH - substituents, help determine the shape of the host cavity in the host –
 guest complex. 
 12.2.5  Resorcinarenes 
 Resorcinarenes have some degrees of freedom for rotation around the C − C bonds of the 
connecting CH 2 - groups, which results in ﬁ ve conformations, namely crown, boat, chair, 
diamond and saddle.  35   The hydroxy groups at the wider rim must be linked in order to ﬁ x 
the receptor in the speciﬁ c cavitand conformation and to improve binding properties. 
 Phenolate resorcin[4]arenes of the type  IV - 1  (Scheme  12.15 ) are efﬁ cient hosts 
for organic ammonium ions in protic solvents in strongly alkaline organic media by 
simultaneous charge – charge and cation – π interaction. 36   A drawback of receptors such as 
 IV - 2  is the low selectivity towards alkyltrimethylammonium and bulkier tetraalkylam-
monium ions. 37 
 Increasing the wall of the resorcinarenes, as in  IV - 3 , could improve the selectivity.  38 
In protic solvents,  IV - 3  could combine the selectivity of cavitands with the high afﬁ nity 
of the resorcin[4]arene. The cavitand is built up if the three diaminophenyl groups adopt 
an axial conformation. The cavity with an open side binds selectively alkylammonium 
ions complementary in size and shape (see Figure  12.1  and Table  12.4 ).     
 The association constants were determined with the help of a competitive displacement 
assay using  B - 17  as a ﬂ uorescence indicator 38   (see Figure  12.2 ). Small changes in size 
have large consequences because the guest is inserted deeply in the cavity. The long 
chains present in  B - 13  can protrude due to the top openings of the host  IV - 3 , resulting 
in high afﬁ nity (Table  12.4 ). In contrast, tetraalkylated ammonium ions, and NH 4 + itself, 
exhibit dramatically weaker complexation behaviour, indicating a bad ﬁ t with the cavity 
of  IV - 3 . The host  IV - 4  exhibits selectivity in binding naturally occurring ammonium ions 
in D 2 O - saturated CDCl 3 solution. 39 Choline  B - 1 (K  =  420  M  − 1 ) and carnitine  B - 16 
(K  =  2050  M  − 1 ), compounds which are poorly soluble in water - saturated chloroform, are 
taken up by this host, but acetylcholine  B - 2 is not. 
 The four - wall water - soluble cavitand  IV - 5 (Scheme  12.16 ) forms a stable deep cavity 
that has a high afﬁ nity towards choline  B - 1  and acetylcholine  B - 2  (association con-
stants > 10 4 M  − 1 ) in D 2 O. 40   Interestingly, the trimethylammonium head of  B - 1 is pointed 
inward into the cavity of the host. In contrast, the long chain trialkylammonium ions, 
such as dodecyltrimethylammonium ion, are bound with the (helical folded) alkyl chain 
in the cavity, but with an association constant of  > 10 4 M  − 1 . In addition to the favourable 
electrostatic interaction between the tetracarboxylate wider rim and the tetraalkylam-
monium core, hydrophobic interactions dominate the binding in this case and reveal 
the bitopic character of both the host and the guest. Isothermal titration calorimetric 
data have shown that the complex formation is both enthalpically and entropically 
driven.

 Chiral discrimination of the host – guest interaction can be measured in the gas phase. 
Resorcin[4]arenes bearing chiral substituents are able to select chiral quaternary ammo-
nium ions. In these cases, complexation experiments were conducted by means of elec-
trospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry. 41 
 12.3  Extended Hosts and Capsules 
 Complexation properties of calixarene hosts may be improved not only by enlarging the 
wall of the host but also by connecting two host molecules by bridges (see Scheme  12.17 ). 
Compared with the  ‘ mono ’ - calix[4]arene  II - 18 , the bridged hosts  II - 19  –  II - 22  exhibit a 
clear increase of the association constants determined with the help of NMR titration in 
CDCl 3  solution (see Figure  12.3 ).  42   In lipophilic media, ion pairs are complexed, and thus, 
different salts of the guest molecules were studied in order to compare complexation 
properties. As expected, both the charge distribution within the cation and the steric 
requirements of the ion pair, in which the anion is tightly bound to the cation, control the 
binding process. The spherical tetramethylammonium ion  B - 10  can bind with only minor 
steric adjustments and no such large differences of the association constants of different 
ion pairs are observed (Table  12.5 ). From CIS values, the structures given in Scheme 
 12.18 are proposed.

 The examples shown above demonstrate the improved binding properties caused by 
connecting two calixarene cavities by bridges at the wider rim. A different feature of 
binding of type A ammonium ions was reported for calix[5]arenes connected by bridges 
at the narrower rim (Scheme  12.19 ).  43 The  1 H NMR titration experiments with long chain 
alkylammonium ions such as  A - 5  reveal the nearly exclusive presence of polycapsular 
assemblies in CDCl 3 /CD 3 OD (9   :   1) solution. Another type of encapsulation of long - chain 
dialkylammonium salts was observed with the heterotetratopic host  II - 24 (Scheme 
 12.19 ). 44 
 Very high association constants ( > 10 6 M  − 1 ) for the formation of the capsular 1  :  1 
complex in CD 2 Cl 2 /CD 3 OD (2   :   1) solution were estimated for alkyl chains of C 12 – C 16 . 
The ureido functionality of the bridge at the wider rim of host  II - 24  supports the compl-
exation in nonprotic solvents by binding with anions such as chloride, picrate, or car-
boxylate (see Figure  12.4 ). Shorter alkyl chains are encapsulated by only a single cavity.

The formation of capsular complexes is further corroborated by ESI mass spectra of 
equimolar host – guest mixtures. 
 While the capsules described above were formed by, at least, bitopic hosts with cova-
lently connected calixarene moieties, capsules are also formed through noncovalent bonds 
such as hydrogen bonds if suitable guests are present. The encapsulation of a guest such 
as the tropylium ion  D - 5  is necessary since an empty cavity would be thermodynamically 
disadvantageous. Dimeric hydrogen - bonded capsules are formed from resorcinarenes 
bearing hydroxyl substituents at the wider rim both in the solid phase and in solution in 
the presence  D - 5  (Scheme  12.20 ). The high thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the 
complex  IV - 6 / D - 5 / IV - 6  arises from the cooperation of eight CO  …  HO hydrogen bonds 
and the cation – π  interaction between the tropylium ion and the resorcinol units (Scheme 
 12.20 ). 45 
 While the capsule  IV - 6 / D - 5 / IV - 6  is stabilized by hydrogen bonds, the cocrystallization 
of resorcinarene  IV - 7  with the rigid diquaternary alkylammonium salt  B - 18  yields a 
nanotubular structure held together by intratubular   π  …   π - interaction (see Figure  12.5 ). 46 
Use of the bromide anion, a weaker hydrogen bond acceptor (compared with chloride), 
drives the assembly process through weaker   π  …  π and cation – π interactions instead of 
hydrogen bonding. In contrast, capsules can be formed from resorcinarenes with the 
diethylammonium ion  B - 11 . 47

 The calix[4]arene  II - 25  (Scheme  12.21 ) is able to form capsules because of ureidoyl 
substituents at the wider rim. Tropylium salts form charge transfer complexes with both 
the monomer and dimers of  II - 25  in nonpolar solvents.  48   Due to hydrogen bonds formed 
in the equatorial region, the afﬁ nity of the tropylium ion towards the capsule formed by 
the dimer is much greater than that of benzene.

 12.4  Cucurbiturils 
 Cucurbiturils (CBs) are relatively poorly soluble in water, with only  CB - 5  and  CB - 7 
possessing modest solubility.  49   However, the solubility of  CB - 5  and  CB - 8 increases 
strongly in concentrated aqueous acid. Because of the negative electrostatic potential 
both at the portals and within the cavity, interaction with cationic guests is preferred. 
Accordingly, alkylammonium ions bind tightly in HCOOH/H 2 O 1  :  1 with association

CBs can lead to a constrictive binding, 51 and, accordingly, the exchange of bound and 
free guests is slow on the  1 H NMR timescale. The narrow portal also causes size selectiv-
ity for alkylammonium guests. While  A - 7 (K  =  80  M  − 1 ) and  A - 9 (K  =  320  M  − 1 ) are readily

functional group to be covalently attached to the AFM tip (see Figure  12.6 ).  53 Using this 
technology, the ammonium ion was shown to be more weakly bound than the trimethy-
lammonium ion. 
 The binding of  C - 3  by a simple calix[4]arene host in nonpolar media can be improved 
by a factor of 25 by the formation of host clusters on the surfaces of gold nanoparticles. 54 
 Applications of host – guest complexes are mainly directed towards the development of 
sensors. For example, acetylcholine detection at micromolar concentration is based on 
inclusion of a ﬂ uorophore containing the pyridinium unit ( trans - 4[4 - (dimethylamino)

styryl] - 1 - methylpyridinium tosylate) in water soluble calixarenes  II - 1  –  II - 3 (Scheme 
 12.6 ). The ﬂ uorescence of the guest is both hypsochromically shifted and drastically 
increased upon complexation. The presence of acetylcholine completely eliminates the 
new emission band of the bound ﬂ uorophore because acetylcholine replaces the ﬂ uoro-
phore within the cavity of the calixarene.  55   A sensor was developed by immobilizing the 
receptor  II - 1  on an oxide - containing silicon surface. An analogous system working in 
alcoholic solution was presented above in Figure  12.2 . 
 As a second example, the coupling of an enzymatic transformation with a dynamic 
host – guest exchange is also based on ﬂ uorescence switching. Combining the decarboxyla-
tion of amino acids with a decarboxylase allows the unselective binding of  CB - 7  to be 
used for highly selective amino acid sensing.  56  CB - 7  binds aliphatic amines and diamines 
in their ammonium form (see above), but the selectivity is low. The neutral ﬂ uorophore 
dapoxyl (Scheme  12.25 ) and the protonated amine, the product of the enzymatic reaction 
under physiological conditions, compete for encapsulation. The emission of the ﬂ uoro-
phore is strongly enhanced upon complexation. The replacement of the ﬂ uorophore by 
the ammonium ion quenches or  ‘ switches off ’ the ﬂ uorescence (see Scheme  12.26 ). The 
enantiospeciﬁ ty of the enzymatic reaction allows the enantioselective recognition of 
analytes with an achiral host.

molecular chemionics is based on molecular recognition.  57   Therefore, hosts with binding 
properties that can be tuned by an outer stimulus are of particular interest. The advantage 
of light driven changes is that no chemical fuels are necessary and no waste products are 
formed. 
 The host cavity of a resorcin[4]arene bearing two anthracene moieties at the wider rim 
can be switched by the known photodimerization of the two anthracene substituents 
resulting in a closed cavity. The process can be reversed by heating of the solution. 
Whereas the cavity of the open state is well suited to bind ammonium ions such as 2 - mer-
captoethylamine hydrochloride, the closed form does not bind ammonium ions. The 
afﬁ nity modulation has also been studied by single - molecule force spectroscopy (Figure 
 12.7 ). For this purpose, the host has been modiﬁ ed with four didecylsulﬁ de linkers in 
order to immobilize the host on gold surfaces. 58

 The cavity of the calix[4]arene  II - 26  bearing two acridane substituents is open and 
suitable to bind guests such as  C - 3 (K  =  1461  ±  458 l  mol  − 1  in CDCl 3  solution) and  C - 4 
(K  =  117  ±  16 l  mol  − 1 ) (Scheme  12.27 and Figure  12.8 ). 59 In contrast, the cavity is blocked 
by two acridinium substituents formed by photoheterolysis.  60   Therefore, the calixarene in 
its acridinium state does not bind guests  C - 2  or  C - 4 . Thus, organic cations can be bound 
and released depending on the state of the host. 
 12.6  Conclusions 
 This chapter has covered some of the developments in the ﬁ eld of supramolecular host –
 guest complexes with organic cations. Cation – π  interaction may play a signiﬁ cant role, 
while charge - charge attraction often supports the binding process. The negative electro-
static potential at the portals and within the cavity of cucurbiturils has important conse-
quences for their recognition of cationic guests. However, a detailed understanding of 
cause/effect relations is difﬁ cult to derive. We have seen the effects of host structure on 
the stability and strength of the complexes through the examples given in this chapter. A 
host should provide a suitable surface and chemical complementarity to the organic cation 
to enable optimal interaction energy. Rigidiﬁ ed calixarenes and resorcinarenes as well as

 Scheme 12.27   Photochemical and thermal switching between  II - 26 and the 
corresponding  II - 27 
extended structures may overcome the entropic losses that occur upon complexation and 
may increase the enthalpic driving force through increased contacts between host and 
guest. In recent years, the complexity of host systems has been considerably increased. 
Modiﬁ ed calixarene and resorcinarene receptors for distinct functionalities are the focus 
of much interest. Switchable receptors and host – guest complexes as sensory material hold 
great promise and will emerge in the near future. In many cases, the physical properties 
of guests (pK - values, ﬂ uorescence efﬁ ciency, chemical reactivity) are changed by com-
plexation which can afford an increasing number of applications. Nevertheless, a greater 
emphasis should be given to extending the understanding of the cause - effect relationships 
of the binding properties in order to facilitate more rational approaches to receptor design.

Proteins as Host for 
Enantioselective Catalysis: Artiﬁ cial 
Metalloenzymes Based on the 
Biotin – Streptavidin Technology 
 Jincheng  Mao and  Thomas R.  Ward 
 Department of Chemistry, University of Basel, CH - 4056 Basel 
 13.1  Introduction 
 In order to meet the ever increasing demand for enantiopure compounds, heterogeneous - , 
homogeneous -  and enzymatic catalysis have evolved independently in the past.  1,2 Although 
all three approaches have yielded industrially viable processes, the latter two are the most 
widely used and can be regarded as complementary in many respects. 3 
 From the viewpoint of molecular encapsulation, enzymes have evolved to accommo-
date and orient their substrate within a well - deﬁ ned environment provided by the protein, 
Figure  13.1 a. In many cases, the substrate is embedded within the enzyme. In contrast, 
homogeneous catalysts typically possess a (chelating) ligand which occupies one hemi-
sphere around the metal, while the substrate occupies the other hemisphere. The main 
effort in catalyst optimization has thus been to extend the reach of the selectivity - orienting 
ligand, Figure  13.1 b. 
 With the aim of complementing the well established ﬁ elds of homogeneous and enzy-
matic catalysis, organocatalysis and artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes have witnessed a recent 
revival. 4,5 Artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes, result from combining an active but unselective 
organometallic moiety with a macromolecular host (protein or DNA), Figure  13.2 . 
 Both Kaiser and Whitesides suggested the possibility of creating artiﬁ cial metalloen-
zymes in the late 1970s already.  6,7   However, there existed a widespread belief that proteins

and organometallic catalysts are incompatible with each other. This severely hampered 
research in this area at the interface between homogeneous and enzymatic catalysis. 8 
Since 2000 however, there has been an increasing interest in the ﬁ eld of artiﬁ cial metal-
loenzymes for enantioselective catalysis. 9 – 13 
 For the localization of an organometallic moiety within a macromolecular host, three 
anchoring strategies can be envisaged: covalent, dative or supramolecular.  5 Using such 
approaches, enantioselective artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes have been created for hydrolysis, 12 
hydrogenation,  14 – 17 transfer hydrogenation, 18 allylic alkylation, 19 sulfoxidation, 20 – 24 epoxi-
dation, 25,26 dihydroxylation, 27 Diels – Alder, 28,29 trans - amination, 30 Michael addition 31 and 
ﬂ uorination. 32   Comparatively, supramolecular anchoring appears as the most appealing, 
since its allows separate variation of both biological and chemical components, followed 
by straightforward combination of the organometallic moiety and the macromolecular 
host. In addition, no chemical modiﬁ cation step is required after the incorporation of the 
catalyst precursor, thus ensuring the integrity of the organometallic species. In recent 
years, we have been exploiting the biotin – avidin technology for the creation of artiﬁ cial 
metalloenzymes for enantioselective catalysis. Herein we summarize the challenges and 
our progress in this area. 
 13.2  The Biotin – Avidin Technology 
 The biotin – avidin technology, often referred to as molecular Velcro, relies on the very 
high afﬁ nity of biotin for either avidin or streptavidin  –  (strept)avidin hereafter.  33 The 
versatility of this technology can be traced back to the following features: 
  i)   
  The nearly irreversible interaction between biotin and (strept)avidin relies solely on 
hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions and thus can reliably take place in a 
variety of environments (cell, blood, surfaces, etc.) under mild conditions. 
  ii)     A straightforward amide bond - forming reaction allows to append a biotin moiety to 
nearly any probe. This derivatization of the valeric acid side chain of biotin does not 
signiﬁ cantly affect the high afﬁ nity of the biotin – avidin couple. 34 
 iii)  (Strept)avidin possesses a homotetrameric   β  - barrel structure with four equivalent 
biotin - binding sites. This allows to bring into proximity different moieties via the 
biotin – avidin technology. 
  iv)     (Strept)avidin is a very robust protein scaffold which can be easily handled by unex-
perienced chemists without the risk of loosing biotin - binding activity. 
 In the past four decades, this versatile tool has found numerous applications in afﬁ nity 
chromatography, signal ampliﬁ cation, drug delivery, immunoassays, immobilization etc.  35 
 Inspired by the pioneering work of Whitesides,  7,17   we reasoned that we could exploit 
the biotin – avidin technology for the creation and optimization of artiﬁ cial metalloen-
zymes. Introduction of a biotin anchor on a chelating ligand ensures the localization of 
an organometallic moiety within a chiral environment provided by (strept)avidin. We 
endeavored to use the modern tools of genetic and chemical optimization to ﬁ ne - tune the 
second coordination sphere of the resulting artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes. The main stages 
include (i) mutation and overexpression of the (strept)avidin isoform in a suitable host, 
(ii) isolation, puriﬁ cation and quantiﬁ cation of the activity of the mutated (strept)avidin,

(iii) synthesis of the biotinylated catalyst precursor and incorporation within (strept)
avidin, (iv) catalysis, and (v) product isolation and analysis. 
 One of the most attractive feature of this approach is the diversity generated by com-
bining both chemical and genetic optimization strategies. 36 Following this approach, we 
have been able to develop artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes for the hydrogenation, the allylic 
alkylation and the transfer hydrogenation reaction. 
 13.2.1  The Chemical Optimization Dimension 
 In the spirit of homogeneous catalyst optimization, variation of the ﬁ rst coordination 
sphere provided by a chelating ligand often has a signiﬁ cant impact on the performance 
of the resulting catalyst. Inspired by some of the best homogeneous catalysts, a series of 
aminodiphosphines and amidosulfonamides were synthesized and coupled with the 
biotin - anchor. We reasonned that introduction of a spacer between the biotin and the 
chelating ligand would project a different chiral environment for each biotin – spacer –
 ligand combination, thus offering a straightforward optimization strategy. The most 
versatile ligands and spacers are sketched in Figure  13.3 . 
 13.2.2  The Genetic Optimization Dimension 
 Considering the ease of recombinant protein production in various hosts, we set out to 
produce streptavidin (Sav hereafter) in  Escherichia coli  and avidin (Avi hereafter) in 
 Pichia pastoris . 37,38   Although in our hands both proteins could be overexpressed to high 
levels (230  mg  l  − 1 cell culture and 330  mg  l  − 1  cell culture respectively) streptavidin was 
eventually preferred over avidin for the following reasons: 
  i)   
  In contrast to streptavidin, avidin is glycosylated. This is a source of inhomogeneity 
and thus may cause reproducibility concerns. In addition, the inhomogeneity renders 
crystallization more challenging. 
  ii)     Each avidin monomer possesses a single intramolecular disulﬁ de bridge. As a con-
sequence, the protein cannot be denatured and renatured, which is a limitation for 
puriﬁ cation purposes. 
 iii)  E. coli  is a well behaved and a very easy to handle organism for the overexpression 
of recombinant proteins. However, it should be emphasized that  P. pastoris secretes 
the recombinant proteins in the culture medium, which could be a major asset for 
future directed evolution studies. 
 In light of the above reasons and considering that our initial success was obtained with 
streptavidin rather than avidin,  14   we rapidly focused on streptavidin and mutants thereof 
as host for artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes. 
 Docking studies performed with either [Rh(COD)(Biot – 1 )] +  or [Ru(  η 6 - arene)H(Biot –
 IIIp – 2 )] within WT - Sav revealed that the potential energy surface describing the localiza-
tion of the metal within the protein environment was ﬂ at and the metal adopted different 
positions within a very small energy window.  39,40   Analysis of the C  α  – M distances revealed 
that the asymmetric carbon (C  α  ) of residue S112 Sav lied systematically closest to the 
metal center. Based on these  in silico  studies, we set out to produce all twenty Sav iso-
forms resulting from saturation mutagenesis at position S112X Sav.  41   Except for S112P

yield and puriﬁ ed from 10 litre  E. coli fermentations.

 Having synthesized a library of biotinylated diphosphine ligands, these were 
reacted with [Rh(COD)] +  and combined with a Sav isoform. The resulting artiﬁ cial

ligands were screened in the presence of the twenty Sav isoforms and WT Avi. Noteworthy 
results are collected in Table  13.1 .  14,41 – 45   Based on these data, the following trends can be 
identiﬁ ed: 
 i) 
 both ( R ) - and ( S ) - enantiomers of the product can be obtained in good enantioselectivi-
ties ( > 90% ee, Table  13.1 entries 1 – 6) 
  ii)     chemical diversity (e.g. variation of the spacer) is a more versatile means for optimi-
zation that genetic diversity. This latter can be regarded as a ﬁ ne tuning step.

  iii)     introduction of conformationally constrained spacers (eg. proline  IV ) confers signiﬁ -
cant organic solvent tolerance to the systems. Both biphasic and DMSO/water mix-
tures yield good conversions and selections (Table  13.1 entries 3 – 5). 45 
 iv)  the artiﬁ cial hydrogenases follow Michaelis - Menten kinetics. Introduction of the 
catalyst within streptavidin contributes to improve both the activity (eg. phenomenon 
of protein accelerated catalysis, compare [Rh(COD)(Biot – 1 )] +  k cat 3.06  min  − 1 ,  K M 
7.38  mM, with [Rh(COD)(Biot – ( R ) - IV – 1 )] +  ⊂  WT Sav  k cat 12.30  min  − 1 ,  K M 4.36  mM) 
and the selectivity. 42 
 v)  although most ligand – protein combinations afford comparable levels of conversion 
and enantioselectivity for both substrates, certain combinations yield substrate spe-
ciﬁ c artiﬁ cial hydrogenases (Table  13.1 entry 6). 
 Having demonstrated the potential of artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes for the reduction of 
 N  - protected dehydroaminoacids, we turned our attention towards organometallic - 
catalyzed reactions where the enantiodiscrimination step occurs without coordination of 
one of the reactants to the metal centre. We anticipated that incorporation of the metal 
complex within a protein environment may steer the enantioselection without requiring 
transient coordination to the metal. In this context, we selected the palladium - catalyzed 
asymmetric allylic alkylation, the ruthenium - catalyzed transfer hydrogenation as well as 
the vanadyl - catalyzed sulfoxidation reaction. Indeed, these reactions are believed to 
proceed without prior coordination of the soft nucleophile, the prochiral ketone or the 
prochiral sulﬁ de respectively, Figure  13.5 . 
 13.4  Artiﬁ cial Allylic Alkylases 
 In the ﬁ eld of C − C bond forming reactions, palladium occupies a privileged position.  46 
In this context, the asymmetric allylic alkylation attracted our interest due to its unique 
outersphere attack of the malonate on the   η 3 - coordinated 1,3 - diphenylallyl moiety. 47 
 Following the above - described chemogenetic optimization procedure, we screened 
twenty one biotinylated ligands in conjunction with twenty two (strept)avidin isoforms 
for the allylic alkylation of 1,3 - diphenylallyl acetate. Addition of didodecyldimethylam-

monium bromide (DMB) allowed to signiﬁ cantly improve the yield of alkylation product 
 –  over the hydrolysis product, 1,3 - diphenylallylalcohol, formed predominantly in the 
absence of DMB (Figure  13.6 ). This screening revealed the following trends:  19 
   i)   
  The nature of the spacer plays a critical role in conferring activity to the artiﬁ cial 
alkylase. In most cases and despite the addition of DMB, hydrolysis product was 
formed predominantly. The best spacers are conformationally constrained: either 
proline  IV or  o - aminobenzoate  IIo , Table  13.2 , entries 1 – 3. 
  ii)     Despite the presence of chaotropic agents (surfactant and basic pH), the artiﬁ cial 
metalloenzyme behave remarkably well. While the high pH is required for the reac-
tion to proceed, the reaction carried out in the absence of DMB leads to a signiﬁ cant 
erosion of the conversion, with only a modest increase in selectivity, Table  13.2 , 
entries 3, 4. 
  iii)     As previously observed for the hydrogenation reaction, conformationally constrained 
ligands confer improved organic solvent tolerance. Reactions with [Pd(  η 3 - allyl)(Biot –
 IIo – 1 )] +  ⊂    S112A Sav can be performed in 45% DMSO without addition of DMB, 
Table  13.2 , entry 5. 48 
  iv)     Again here, the versatility of the chemical optimization allowed to rapidly identify 
an active biotinylated ligand. The genetic optimization can be regarded as a ﬁ ne 
tuning step: whereas most streptavidin isoforms yielded ( R ) - alkylation products in

( S ) - alkylation product, Table  13.2 entry 6. 
 13.5  Artiﬁ cial Transfer Hydrogenase 
 The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones is an effective way to prepare enan-
tiopure alcohols.  49   We were attracted to this reaction as we anticipated that one could 
exploit the reversibility of the reaction to perform either for the enantioselective reduc-
tion or for the kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols via oxidation.  50 This behaviour 
is reminiscent of alcohol dehydrogenases which can operate either as oxidases or 
reductases. 2 
 Incorporation of a biotinylated d6 - piano - stool complex bearing a biotinylated amino-
sulfonamide ligand into streptavidin afforded artiﬁ cial transfer hydrogenases for the 
reduction of acetophenone derivatives. A buffered solution (pH 6.25) containing sodium 
formate as a hydrogen source proved best in terms of conversion and of selectivity. 
Unexpectedly, the performance of the artiﬁ cial metalloenzyme was improved by raising 
the temperature to 55  ° C. 18,39,51   A combined chemogenetic procedure combining 21 piano 
stool complexes with the twenty S112X Sav isoforms allowed to optimize the activity 
and the selectivity of these hybrid catalysts for the reduction of prochiral ketones, Figure 
 13.7 . The following trends were identiﬁ ed: 52 
 i) 
 Only catalysts bearing the  para - substituted spacer biot – III p – 2  afforded any signiﬁ -
cant level of conversion. 
 ii)  Ruthenium - based catalysts [Ru(  η 6 - arene)H(Biot – III p – 2 )] outperformed either 
rhodium or iridium based systems [M(  η 5 - C 5 Me 5 )H(Biot – III p – 2 )]. 
 iii)  Under otherwise identical conditions, the benzene [Ru(  η 6 - p - benzene)H(Biot – III p – 2 )] 
and the  p - cymene [Ru(  η 6 - p - cymene)H(Biot – III p – 2 )] complexes afforded opposite 
enantiomers, Table  13.3 , entries 1, 2. 
  iv)     Various acetophenone derivatives could be reduced with good enantioselectivities up 
to 92% ee for ( S ) - products and 97% ee for ( R ) - products, Table  13.3 , entries 3, 4. 
  v)     In contrast, the selectivities obtained for the reduction of dialkylketones remained 
modest, Table  13.3 , entries 5, 6.

 In the context of transfer - hydrogenation, dialkylketones are challenging substrates as 
the major contribution to the enantiodiscrimination event is believed to be C − H · · · · · · π 
interactions between the   η 6  - bound arene and the phenyl moiety on the prochiral substrate, 
Figure  13.5 . 53 – 55   We anticipated that the introduction of additional sites of mutation in the 
proximity of the piano - stool moiety may allow to address this challenge. For this purpose, 
we invested considerable effort into crystallizing the most promising ( R ) - and ( S ) - selective 
artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes: [Ru( η 6 - benzene)Cl(Biot – III p – 2 )]  ⊂    S112K Sav and [Ru(  η 6 - p -

former and its structure is depicted in Figure  13.8 .  51   Based on this structure, we performed 
an additional round of mutations, concentrating on the close lying K121 and L124 resi-
dues and using WT Sav, S112K and S112A as background, thus affording a total 120 Sav 
isoforms. In order to speed up the optimization process, a straightforward Sav immobili-
zation procedure was implemented.  51 For this purpose, commercially available bioti-
nylated sepharose was added to the supernatant of the  E. coli  lysed cell cultures. After 
centrifugation, the immobilized Sav mutants, which on average possessed three remaining 
biotin - binding sites, are treated with an excess of [Ru(  η 6 - arene)Cl(Biot – III p – 2 )], and 
washed and tested in the presence of Sav. This second optimization round allowed to 
identify artiﬁ cial transfer hydrogenases which displayed much improved selectivities 
towards dialkylketones, Table  13.3 , entries 7, 8. 
 Having developed an efﬁ cient artiﬁ cial transfer hydrogenase, we attempted to apply 
the same methodology to the reverse reaction: the kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols. 
To our disappointment, we were forced to use strong oxidizing agents (eg.  t - BuOOH 
rather than acetone, in the spirit of an Oppenauer - type mechanism) to drive the reaction 
to completion.  56   We speculate that, in the presence of water, the ruthenium is unable to 
abstract the   β - hydrogen on the prochiral alcohol. 
 Despite the excitement generated by the X - ray structure, the localization of the bioti-
nylated metal complex within the protein environment was a source of disappointment. 
Indeed, we anticipated that the active catalyst would be encapsulated within the biotin -
 binding pocket of Sav rather than on the surface of the protein. To overcome this problem 
we tested whether the polar residues present within the biotin - binding pocket itself may 
be capable of binding a polar coordination complex. With this goal in mind, we tested 
the catalytic potential of vanadyl as a catalyst.  57

 13.6  Enantioselective Sulfoxidation Based on Vanadyl - loaded Streptavidin 
 Addition of vanadyl sulfate to Sav affords an artiﬁ cial oxidase for the sulfoxidation of 
prochiral sulﬁ des. The system is most efﬁ cient at low pH (2.2) and organic peroxides are 
required for efﬁ cient catalysis, Figure  13.9 . From the screening, the following trends 
emerge: 21 
 i) 
 A variety of prochiral sulﬁ des are oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxides with no 
overoxidation.  
  ii)     At room temperature and relying on 0.02 equivalents vanadium, the conversions are 
complete in most cases and the ( R ) - selectivities often exceed 90%, Table  13.4 , entries 
1 - 5. 
 iii)  Since there is no ligand, the system cannot be optimized chemically. 
 iv)  In the presence of biotin - loaded Sav, the sulfoxidation with VOSO 4  affords racemic 
product, suggesting that vanadium cannot compete for binding with biotin, Table 
 13.4 , entry 6.

  v)     It is widely recognized that residue D128 Sav is most important in biotin - binding.  58 
The mutant D128A Sav affords racemic sulfoxide, thus suggesting that the vanadyl 
moiety is located within the biotin - binding site, Table  13.4 , entry 7.

a chimaeric protein (Aviloop)  59   with improved properties for the sulfoxidation of

 13.7  Conclusions and Outlook 
 As summarized here, artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes based on the biotin – avidin technology 
have developed into a versatile approach to enantioselective catalysis. In many cases, 
selectivities exceeding 92% ee could be obtained, relying on a chemogenetic optimization 
strategy. Such hybrid catalysts display features which are reminiscent of both homogene-
ous and enzymatic catalysis. 
 Comparing alternative anchoring strategies (i.e. dative, covalent or supramolecular),  5 
we speculate that a dative anchoring between an amino acid side chain and the catalyti-
cally active metal moiety may provide an attractive means to ensure a better encapsula-
tion. In this context, one should mention the interesting results recently disclosed by the 
groups of Kazlauskas and Soumillon.  25,26   Substitution of Zn by Mn in carbonic anhydrase 
yields an artiﬁ cial epoxidase (up to 55% ee ( R )). Along similar lines, Sheldon and co -
 workers investigated the sulfoxidation properties of a vanadium - incorporated phytase. 
After incorporation of vanadate into phytase from  A .  ﬁ cuum , the resulting semisynthetic 
peroxidase displayed moderate enantioselectivity (up to 66% ee ( S )) for the sulfoxidation 
of thioanisole derivatives in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, with very little detectable 
overoxidation.  20   In contrast to our systems, the above two examples of artiﬁ cial metal-
loenzymes display a very narrow substrate scope. This suggests that the dative anchoring 
strategy provides a more  ‘ enzyme - like ’  second coordination sphere environment (i.e. 
Lock - and - Key) for the substrate. 
 Although the reactions implemented so far are limited to model systems, we believe 
that artiﬁ cial metalloenzymes will reveal their full potential for transformations for 
which there exists to date no good homogeneous catalyst. In this context, our current 
efforts are directed towards the hydroxylation of alkanes (where overoxidation is dif-
ﬁ cult to prevent with homogeneous systems) as well as highly sequence - speciﬁ c DNA 
hydrolysis.

 14.1  Introduction 
 One of the most fascinating questions at the interface of chemistry and biology is how 
enzymes achieve the catalysis of chemical reactions. These biocatalysts bring about 
tremendous rate accelerations under mild conditions with often extreme chemo - , regio -  
and stereoselectivities. For decades, generations of biochemists, enzymologists and struc-
tural biologists have been attracted to this phenomenon, and consequently, a rather 
thorough understanding has been achieved regarding the catalytic mechanisms of protein 
enzymes. 
 As enzymes encapsulate multiple functionalities within their catalytic cavity, they have 
also served as a major source of inspiration for the ﬁ elds of biomimetic chemistry and 
supramolecular catalysis. Early mechanistic theories about how enzymes work have 
prompted scientists from various ﬁ elds to explore similar approaches for synthetic 
systems. One of these approaches is host - guest catalysis, where one or more substrates 
are bound in a cavity next to the catalytically active site. 
 Enzymes are, however, much more than just a combination of substrate binding site 
and the catalytically active site. Important contributions to enzymatic catalysis arise from 
substrate preorganization, restriction of substrate motion, catalyst dynamics, transition 
state binding, and desolvation of the substrates, and natural evolution has used these

strategies over long periods of time to ﬁ ne - tune catalytic properties. In synthetic systems, 
such effects could so far only be utilized to a lesser extent. 
 Since the early 1980s it has become clear that the exclusive assignment of enzymatic 
activity to the chemical substance class of proteins in incorrect, as ribonucleic acids were 
discovered that possess such activities. Most of these naturally occurring  ‘ ribozymes ’ 
(shortened for  ‘ ribo nucleic acid en zymes ’  catalyse (at least to our present - day knowledge) 
the hydrolysis and formation of phosphodiester bonds, and for some of these systems, 
high - resolution crystal structures and mechanistic investigations provide a basis for an 
understanding of how these ribozymes work. 1,2 Combinatorial chemistry on the other hand 
has allowed to isolate (or generate) RNA and also DNA catalysts with activities not 
known to exist in biology. It turns out that  –  although equipped with a much less varied 
arsenal of chemically different building blocks  –  nucleic acids can form tertiary structures 
with binding pockets and catalytic centres very much like proteins. 
 The history of ribozymes, in the true sense of the word, is connected to the so - called 
RNA world,  3,4   a hypothetic prebiotic stage in the evolution of life, where the majority of 
catalytic functions were effected by RNA, and proteins not yet existed. The idea of an 
RNA world alone implies that RNA should be practically omnipotent in the diversity of 
its catalytic potential, despite having been outperformed by proteins later on. The inves-
tigation of RNA catalysis provides a simpliﬁ ed and contrasting perspective on macro-
molecular catalytic mechanisms compared with protein enzymes, and an improved 
understanding of the chemical origins of ribozyme catalysis may add to our knowledge 
on macromolecular catalysis in general. 
 While enzymological research over several decades has provided a rather detailed 
understanding of how certain enzymes accelerate chemical reactions, knowledge about 
ribozyme mechanisms and catalytic strategies is scarce in comparison. For some natural 
ribozymes, mechanistic and structural studies were carried out, but artiﬁ cial ribozymes 
remain largely uncharacterized. Therefore it is unclear in many cases whether these cata-
lysts are passive containers working solely by substrate pre - organization, or whether there 
are speciﬁ c effects on the activation parameters of the reaction. 
 In this review, I will ﬁ rst give a brief overview on the types of chemical reactions cata-
lysed by naturally occurring ribozymes, including some mechanistic considerations. This 
is followed by a discussion of the methods used for generating new nucleic acid enzymes, 
and a compilation of artiﬁ cial ribozymes and deoxyribozymes. Finally, I will discuss the 
current knowledge on the arguably best - characterized artiﬁ cial ribozymes, namely RNA 
enzymes that catalyse the formation of C − C bonds by Diels – Alder reaction, with special 
emphasis on crystallographic and complementary mechanistic investigations. 
 14.2  Catalysis by Naturally Occurring Ribozymes 
 In the contemporary biosphere, ribozymes carry out a limited range of chemical reactions, 
mostly involving phosphoryl transfer, and in particular transesteriﬁ cation and hydrolysis 
reactions at internucleotide phosphodiester bonds (Table  14.1 ). They are widespread in 
nature, from bacteria and their phages, archaea, to yeasts and fungi and higher eukaryotes, 
and are used by these organisms mostly for processing of certain ribonucleic acids. They 
either cut oligomeric replication products to unity length, a crucial process in viral repli-

cation, they trim the ends of the precursors of tRNA, they remove an internal sequence 
fragment (intron) from a precursor transcript, or they destroy an mRNA in response to a 
signal. All these reactions are highly site - and sequence - speciﬁ c. In some cases, these 
ribozymes act on themselves (self - cleavage or  in - cis  cleavage, i.e., they are enzyme and 
substrate at the same time), in others they act as true enzymes on external RNA substrates 
( in - trans  cleavage). The RNA - cleaving enzymes can be grouped by the nature of the 
nucleophile they use for RNA cleavage (Table  14.1 ): They either utilize the 2 ′ - hydroxyl 
group of the ribose adjacent to the phosphodiester bond to be cleaved (small viral 
and viroidal RNAs), or a distant 2 ′  - OH group (in splicing, group II introns), a water 
molecule (Ribonuclease P), or a small organic molecule (group I introns). Finally, 
the peptidyl transferase activity of the ribosome is also ribozyme - based and catalyses 
what is arguably the most important reaction of the cell, the condensation of amino acids 
into polypeptides. 
 Just as protein enzymes must be correctly folded into the conformation required for 
catalytic activity, so must RNA. In general, the precise nature of Watson – Crick base 
pairing leads to the relatively easy formation of secondary structure. Most critical for 
catalysis and substrate binding is, however, the formation of the tertiary structure. The 
negatively charged phosphate backbone of RNA results in a strong electrostatic contribu-
tion to this process, and therefore metal ions play important roles in RNA structure for-
mation. The folded RNA structure can bind metal ions, either site - speciﬁ cally or diffusely, 
and these bound ions can play a direct role in catalysis. 1,2 
 Compared to proteins, RNA has only very limited resources to build a catalytic site. 
Only four monomeric building blocks with low structural and chemical diversity can be 
utilized. The nucleobases have hydrogen bond donors and acceptors that can be used to 
bind the substrate, and potentially to stabilize a transition state. In principle they could 
also act as general acids and bases, but their p K a  values are either too high or too low to 
make them signiﬁ cant contributors at physiological pH values. This situation can, however, 
be changed by neighbouring phosphate groups or metal ions. The second potential players 
are metal ions, and their associated water molecules. Metal ions can act as Lewis acids, 
or provide electrostatic stabilization of negative charge in a transition state. Water mol-
ecules contained within the inner coordination sphere may participate in general acid – base 
catalysis. In addition to chemical participants, RNA can also potentially exploit its struc-
ture to contribute to catalysis. Substrate binding can result in acceleration of

reaction velocity due to proximity and orientation, together with structural stabilization 
of the transition state. 
 Given the relative paucity of potential catalytic groups present in RNA molecules, 
ribozymes achieve some impressive rate accelerations. Typical values for the RNA -
 cleaving ribozymes reach about 10 6  - fold over the background reaction, with rates of 
 ∼ 1  min  − 1 , and some variants were reported to reach over 10  s  − 1 . 
 The ﬁ eld of natural ribozymes has been extensively reviewed. 1,2 
 14.3  How to Generate Artiﬁ cial  RNA and  DNA Catalysts 
 RNA molecules with new catalytic activities were ﬁ rst reported in the 1990s. These were 
isolated by a technique termed  in vitro  selection or SELEX (systematic evolution of 
ligands by exponential enrichment), starting from synthetic combinatorial RNA libraries 
(pools), which typically contain 10 14 – 10 15  different sequences, i.e., 10 14 – 10 15 chemically 
different compounds. These enormous complexities can only be handled since nucleic 
acid molecules are genetically encoded, i.e., they carry the information for their own 
replication. This property allows for an iterative deconvolution of the libraries over 
several rounds. Such SELEX experiments have led to nucleic acids that catalyse a broad 
range of chemical transformations, ranging from cleavage of amide - or carboxylic ester 
bonds to amide - bond - , C − C - and C − S - bond forming reactions to the catalysis of redox 
reactions (see below). 
 The vast majority of in vitro selection experiments, however, did not focus on catalysts 
but on RNA molecules that speciﬁ cally bind a given target molecule, so - called aptamers.  5 
The most crucial step in any variant of this technique is selection, meaning an effective 
distinction between desired and undesired species. It is in the selection step that the most 
decisive advances in ribozyme discovery were made, as will become clear in the discus-
sion below. The standard selection event in aptamer SELEX is a binding event, and 
consequently the desired molecules can be distinguished from the rest by physical separa-
tion, namely by afﬁ nity chromatography. 
 The basic (aptamer) SELEX protocol starts with a chemically synthesized DNA library 
(Figure  14.1 ). By using monomer (phosphoramidite) mixtures in solid phase oligonucle-
otide synthesis, huge complexities can be easily achieved. If, for example, a stretch of 20 
nucleotides is synthesized completely random by using a mixture of the four standard 
monomers, a mixture of 4  20 or 10 12   different DNA sequences is generated. In the second 
step, the single - stranded DNA is made double - stranded, and several copies are made by 
using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using a DNA - dependent RNA polymerase, a 
single - stranded RNA library is ﬁ nally generated from the double - stranded DNA library 
that is used as input for the ﬁ rst round of selection. The target that the RNA molecules 
are expected to bind is immobilized on a solid support, and the RNA library is added and 
allowed to interact for a certain period of time. Non - binding RNAs are removed by 
washing, while binders are recovered. They are then converted into cDNA by reverse 
transcription, ampliﬁ ed by PCR, and this cycle is repeated several times until a signiﬁ cant 
fraction of the RNA binds to the immobilized target with high afﬁ nity. The enzymatic 
steps require the incorporation of certain constant sequence elements (primer binding 
sites, promoters) into the design of the starting library.

Chemical Reactions with RNA and DNA Enzymes

 Conceptually starting from this basic SELEX protocol, several strategies to create 
RNAs with catalytic properties were developed. The ﬁ rst one relies on transition state 
analogues (TSAs) and had been emulated from the catalytic antibodies ﬁ eld. Aptamers 
against transition state analogs of different reactions were raised and tested for catalytic 
activity. The Schultz group reported catalysis of a biphenyl isomerisation  6 and porphyrin 
metalation reaction.  7   Cholesterol esterase activity of yet another RNA isolated by the TSA 
approach was found by Chun  et al . 8   While all these RNAs act as catalysts, the rate accel-
eration was rather low (below 500 - fold in most cases), as compared to 10 3 – 10 5  for most 
TSA antibodies and up to 10 18  for natural enzymes. Other attempts to isolate catalytic 
RNAs via TSAs, for example for Diels – Alder reactions, have thus far remained at the 
stage of aptamer binding. 9 
 Better acceleration rates and catalysis of more complex reactions were obtained by 
direct selection. In this strategy, selection is not based on a binding event; rather it is 
based directly on the desired catalytic event. For example, if the to - be - catalysed reaction 
is phosphodiester hydrolysis, the RNA library is immobilized on solid support. The selec-
tion event is thus directly tailored to hydrolysis: active molecules cleave their covalent 
linkage to the solid support and thus dissociate from it. The catalytic event thus enables 
spatial separation of active and inactive molecules. Direct selection has therefore allowed 
to isolate catalysts for numerous RNA - modifying reactions, from hydrolysis and ligation 
to RNA alkylation, acylation, phosphorylation and many others (see below). 
 The use of reactants other than RNA in direct selection allows targeting of more 
complex reactions. An essential prerequisite is the attachment of a (non - RNA) reactant 
X to the RNA molecules, i.e., conversion of the RNA library into a RNA - reactant library. 
Assuming a desired RNA catalyst of the chemical reaction X    →    Z, which may include 
simple addition as in X  +  Y  →    Z, the selection has to be designed in a way to isolate

all RNA library members carrying the target reaction product Z. This can be through 
chemical trapping or afﬁ nity puriﬁ cation of Z directly, or by designing Y in a way that 
the ﬁ nal product contains a functional moiety of Y which allows facile afﬁ nity 
puriﬁ cation. 
 An exciting example for the former case is the ribocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol 
to benzaldehyde using NAD +  as a cofactor: the desired aldehyde product was chemically 
trapped by a biotin - conjugated hydrazine derivative.  10   This case will be more explicitly 
discussed below. The latter case has been successfully demonstrated by several labs 
employing a biotin - conjugated reactant Y thus allowing puriﬁ cation of the reactive species 
by immobilized streptavidin, a biotin - binding protein. A variant of direct selection uses 
tethered reactants. This design, tailored to ﬁ nd catalysts for the chemical addition of 
compound Y to compound X to yield the addition product Z, is depicted in Figure  14.2 . 
Reactant X is now attached to the RNA via a long poly(ethylene glycol) tether, allowing 
it to interact with potential catalytic pockets in the RNA that are spatially remote from 
either extremity. In our lab, using tethered reactants, a ribozyme was selected that cataly-
ses a Diels – Alder reaction. Anthracene tethered to RNA via a PEG - linker corresponds to 
reactant X, in this case a diene, and biotin - maleimide was employed as reactant Y, the 
free dienophile.  11   This design allowed easy isolation of the reaction product Z by strepta-
vidin agarose. 
 Depending on the reactivity of reactant Y towards the functional groups contained in 
RNA, its conjugation to species of the RNA library will occur with more or less site -
 speciﬁ city to the conjugated X - reactant. More reactive Ys may add to RNA at positions

other than the desired reactant X, thus also fulﬁ lling the practical requirements for selec-
tion and ampliﬁ cation. Results of such selections were occasionally reported in the litera-
ture. 12   A strategy to circumvent non - speciﬁ c addition involves the incorporation of a 
chemically orthogonal cleavage site between reactant X and the RNA library. After 
immobilization as a primary selection event, a secondary selection event is created by a 
treatment targeted speciﬁ cally to the cleavage site. If immobilization of a given RNA 
sequence is based on addition of reactant Y to reactant X with correct site speciﬁ city, the 
cleavage will release the desired sequence into solution for ampliﬁ cation. However, addi-
tion of Y to sites other than X anywhere in the RNA will result in persistent immobiliza-
tion during the secondary selection event, thus effectively removing unwanted species 
from the ampliﬁ cation cycle. The chemistry used for the cleavage event in the secondary 
selection step should not interact in any way with the rest of the conjugated library. 
Orthogonal approaches described to - date include a disulﬁ de bridge embedded within the 
tether, and photocleavable  o - nitrobenzyl groups. 
 The strategies to generate catalytic DNA molecules are almost identical and start with 
the same type of libraries. While one would intuitively expect that these selections are 
easier to perform since transcription and reverse transcription are eliminated from the 
selection cycles, in practice they are not, since the double - stranded DNA libraries result-
ing from PCR - type ampliﬁ cations are catalytically incompetent, and their conversion into 
high - quality single - stranded DNA libraries is not trivial. 
 14.4  The Catalytic Spectrum of Artiﬁ cial Ribozymes 
 In the following the scope of  in vitro  selected ribozymes will be described with special 
regard to organic chemistry. Several highlights will be discussed in detail. In Table  14.2  
the variety of reactions catalysed by ribozymes is summarized. 
 The catalytic spectrum of RNA can not be discussed without the background of a 
hypothetical prebiotic RNA world. As stated in the introduction, the concept of an RNA 
world means that RNA, at one point, may have performed almost all catalytic functions 
necessary for survival. As Woese points out,  25   the term survival does not necessarily apply 
to a discrete, living entity or even to distinct species, be they single molecules or single 
cells. Therefore, and because it is unclear which chemical reactions exactly might have 
been catalysed by RNA or other matter like catalytic surfaces, a complete picture of the 
RNA ’ s catalytic potential does not come with the RNA world hypothesis. Yet, there is a 
high number of chemical reactions and properties which have been predicted to occur in 
an RNA world. For a large number of the most important reactions, proof of the catalytic 
potential has meanwhile been given, including for example ribonucleotide polymeriza-
tion, aminoacylation, and peptide bond formation. 26 
 Although the RNA world presumably existed almost four billion years ago, X - ray -
 structures of the ribosome seem to exhibit fragments of this ancestral era. The structures 
revealed that RNA - mediated catalysis plays an important role in the peptide synthesis of 
the ribosome. The key step in translation is catalysed only by the ribonucleic acid com-
ponent of the ribosome, without any direct contribution of proteins from the spatial vicin-
ity. That impressively demonstrates the catalytic potential of RNA in a biochemical 
reaction that may arguably be called the most important ever.

 An artiﬁ cial ribozyme mimics this translation step of the ribosome.  27 The speciﬁ ty of 
this selected ribozyme is based on the recognition of an adenosine moiety of the amino 
acid ester and allows the utilization of leucine -  and phenylalanine -  as well as methionine -
 derivatized substrates. This tolerance for various amino acids indicates the possibility of 
selecting more general ribozymes for protein synthesis. Furthermore, a related ribozyme 
efﬁ ciently catalyses the synthesis of  ∼ 30 different dipeptides from an aminoacyl - adenylate 
substrate. Ribozyme - mediated synthesis of uncoded peptides might have been an impor-
tant step in the transition from a RNA to a peptide world before the emergence of the 
ribosome.  28 
 Another important development was the isolation of a ribozyme which performs nucle-
otide synthesis by forming a glycosidic linkage from activated ribose (pRpp)  17 in a way 
similar to the modern biosynthesis of nucleotides. 
 Before the discovery of catalytic RNA, the principal indications of a possible RNA 
world had been the role of tRNA and ribosomal RNA in translation, the use of RNA as 
genetic material in retroviruses, and the ubiquitous occurrence of RNA - related enzymatic 
co - substrates like GTP, ATP, AMP, cAMP, SAM, FADH 2  and NAD +  in all major meta-
bolic pathways. Clearly, the capability of RNA to employ these and other ubiquitous 
co - substrates in catalysis must be expected. 26 
 Deﬁ nitively a highlight in ribozyme research is the  in vitro  evolution of a ribozyme 
that oxidizes an alcohol in a NAD +  dependent manner. The resulting RNA - aldehyde was
