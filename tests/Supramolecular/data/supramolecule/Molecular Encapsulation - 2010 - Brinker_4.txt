Fujita and co - workers (Figure  6.5 ). 40,41 By a slight adjustment in the architecture of the 
linking unit, i.e. employing 2,4,6 - tris(3 - pyridyl) - 1,3,5 - triazine, and using the same rela-
tive ratio of 6  :  4 (M  :  L) the related half - open, square - pyramidal cage  E was formed. 
 Within these aggregates, the corners of the octahedron are deﬁ ned by the metal com-
plexes, whereas the faces of the octahedron are occupied by the planar tripodal ligand 
scaffolds. As a consequence of the use of neutral donor ligands, the resulting hexanuclear 
complex carries a high overall positive charge and thus shows appreciable solubility in 
aqueous media, featuring a hydrophobic inner environment. As a result, these cages are 
very suitable hosts to accommodate a range of neutral and anionic guest molecules, 
including ferrocene and adamantane. Guest exchange can take place via the relatively 
large pores of the host. The large inner cavity has a diameter of approx. 2.2   nm and allows 
encapsulation of one to four guest molecules per cage, depending on the guest size. The 
coordination cage  D  can selectively recognize two different guests, such as one anthra-
cene - type molecule and one maleimide - type molecule, in a pair - wise manner. Remarkably, 
no external guests are needed in order to selectively form the Pd - based octahedral cage 
and the cage can be prepared at large scale (up to 50 g). This indicates that also polar 
solvents such as water can be included under judicious conditions. The Fujita group has 
reported many other types of cage structures, but cage  D  has been mostly used as reaction 
vessel.

 The octahedral coordination cage  D  described by Fujita and co - workers has been applied 
as a nanoreactor for bimolecular Diels – Alder reactions in water.  17 Suspending

near - stoichiometric quantities of  D resulted in the selective formation of [ D  ⊃  7  •  8a ] 
(Scheme  6.4 a). Upon warming the reaction mixture, the Diels – Alder product  9a formed 
in excess of 98% and could be subsequently isolated by extraction with chloroform. The 
nanoreactor induces unusual regioselectivity by promoting reaction at the terminal anthra-
cene ring to give the syn - 1,4 - Diels – Alder adduct  9a , while reaction in the bulk solvent 
yields the product bridging at the central anthracene ring, the 1,9 - Diels – Alder adduct, in 
44%. The unusual stereo -  and regioselectivity observed for the encapsulated Diels – Alder 
reaction are explained by the ﬁ xed orientation of the two substrates within  D , preventing 
interaction at the 9,10 position of the anthracene  7 . This is an example where preorganiza-
tion within the nanoreactor prevents the energetically most favoured product. However, 
product inhibition by strong complexation of  9a within  D prevents catalytic turnover. 
 Interestingly, the Diels – Alder reaction of the anthracene  7  and  N - phenylmaleimide  8b 
could be performed in a catalytic fashion using 10 mol % of a square - pyramidal bowl  E . 
In this reaction the conventional regiochemistry of the 1,9 - Diels – Alder adduct  9b (Scheme 
 6.4 b) was obtained, but in excellent yield (99%), whereas without the nanoreactor present, 
only 3% conversion was observed under the same conditions.  17 Bowl  E  does not suffer 
from product inhibition because its open structure allows facile guest exchange (no kinetic 
traps), and the afﬁ nity for the substrate and product is based on aromatic stacking, which 
is more pronounced for the substrate than for product  9b . It is unknown if the rate 
acceleration is caused by effective concentration and/or transition - state stabilization. 
Remarkably, nanoreactor  D  can also efﬁ ciently promote the Diels – Alder reaction of 
highly stable and relative inert aromatic molecules such as triphenylene and perylene with 
 8a  to give the corresponding  endo Diels – Alder adduct with  syn  stereochemistry in high

orientation of the substrate within the cavity of  D . 
 6.7.2  Oleﬁ n Photodimerization 
 The octahedral coordination cage  D  has been used by Fujita and co - workers as a 
nanoreactor for the bimolecular [2+2] photodimerization of oleﬁ ns. 43 Suspending bulky 
oleﬁ ns such as acenaphthylenes  10a  or  10b  in an aqueous solution of  D  resulted in 
complexes [ D  ⊃  ( 10a ) 2 ] and [ D  ⊃  ( 10b ) 2 ], respectively (Scheme  6.5 a). Isolation and 
irradiation of these complexes yielded the encapsulated  syn - dimers [ D  ⊃  11a ] and 
[ D  ⊃  11b ] in  > 98%. The products were isolated by extraction with chloroform. Compared 
to the non - encapsulated photodimerization of  10a  in benzene, the nanoreactor acceler-
ated the reaction and improved the stereoselectivity for the  syn - dimer  11a  from 53% 
to 100%. In addition, the nanoreactor protected the encapsulated product  11a against 
photodissociation. Photodimerization of the non - symmetrically substituted 1 - methyla-
cenaphthylene  10b  can yield up to four different isomers. Under standard conditions, 
however, no dimerization occurs due to the steric hindrance of the methyl group, but 
photodimerization of  10b  within nanoreactor  D  does occur with a high stereo -  and 
regioselectivity, as is demonstrated by the exclusive formation of the head - to - tail 
 syn - dimer  11b . 
 The cross - photodimerization reaction represents a great challenge because it requires 
 D  to selectively recognize two different oleﬁ ns in a pair - wise fashion prior to irradiation, 
whereas the cross - coupling reaction under standard conditions shows no preference over 
the homo - coupling. The cross - photodimerization of acenaphthylene with substituted 
naphthoquinones within  D  resulted in exclusive formation of the cross syn - dimer only

for 5 - ethoxynaphthoquinone, while the less steric oleﬁ ns, having no substituent or a 
5 - methoxy group, yielded mixtures of homo -  and heterodimers (Scheme  6.5 b).  44 In addi-
tion, even relatively inert polycyclic aromatic compounds such as pyrene, phenanthrene 
and ﬂ uoranthene were selectively [2+2] cross - photodimerized with  N - cyclohexylmaleimide 
within  D , resulting in high stereo -  and regioselectivity.  42   Again, the steric demand of the 
 N  - cyclohexyl group of the maleimide is essential, as less sterically demanding groups 
were not reactive in the photodimerization with pyrene. 
 Subsequent work has established the formation of chiral derivatives of nanoreactor  D 
through the use of chiral diamine end - capping groups instead of ethylenediamine as ligand 
on the Pd building blocks and subsequent self - assembly with functionalized triazine 
frameworks. These chiral nanocages are able to remotely control the chiral [2+2] photo 
addition of ﬂ uoranthenes and several maleimides, a reaction previously unknown to be 
performed in an asymmetric fashion, in up to 50% ee. 45 
 Substrate desolvation and the hydrophobic environment within the cavity create a  new 
inner phase  for new applications. Indeed, the water - soluble nanoreactor  D  with a hydro-
phobic cavity has been used as phase - transfer catalyst for Wacker oxidation of styrene in 
an aqueous phase.  46   Another interesting feature of nanoreactors is their molecular frame 
that can play an active role during reaction of encapsulated molecules. For example, the 
triazine ligands of Fujita octahedral cage  D  can be photochemically excited; subsequent 
electron transfer from an encapsulated alkane (i.e. adamantane) to the cage induces sub-
strate oxidation by O 2  (or H 2 O, depending on reaction conditions), via the intermediacy 
of an adamantyl radical and the triazine - based radical anion of cage  D . 47 Also, the pho-
tochemical cyclization of diphenylethanedione, concomitant with effective suppression 
of photolytic cleavage of the substrate was reported to be enhanced by nanoreactor  D . 48 
Photomediated 1,4 - radical additions to quinones are another example where the con-
strained enclathration of substrate molecules in  D  enforces unusual reactivity.  49 No 
mention was made on the potential interaction or involvement of the photoactive cage -
 faces (the triazine scaffolds) in the latter two cases. 
 As mentioned previously, nanoreactors can also stabilize  in - situ  generated reactive 
intermediates and labile products like in the oligomerization of trialkoxysilanes within  D , 
which could not be isolated in the absence of this nanoreactor.  26 
 6.8  Hydrophobic Effects as the Driving Force for the Self - Assembly 
of Nanocapsules 
 Gibb and co - workers have used water - soluble cavitands that self - assemble into capsule 
 F . The assembly process is based on hydrophobic effects (and possibly on non - directional 
 π – π  stacking between the two building blocks) and the capsule formation occurred only 
in the presence of hydrophobic guests that function as template. 50 
 The template plays an important role in the formation of capsule  F  because no direc-
tional non - covalent bonds such as H - bonding and M – L interactions are involved in the 
self - assembly process. In addition, an external hydrophobic template is necessary because 
aqueous solvent does not template the formation of  F . Capsule  F  consists of two octa -
 acid, deep - cavity cavitands with a pseudo - conical hydrophobic cavity (Figure  6.6 a). The 
eight carboxylic acid groups are located at the periphery of the cavitand, thereby inducing

high water - solubility under basic conditions. The cavitands dimerize upon encapsulation 
of complementary hydrophobic templates, e.g. a rigid steroid or two smaller alkanes 
(Figure  6.6 b). As mentioned above, the capsule is also held together by non - directional 
 π – π  stacking interactions between the aromatic rings on the wide hydrophobic rim of the 
two cavitands; therefore the structural integrity of these capsules is not ﬁ xed. Capsule  F 
has a calculated internal cavity of approx. 500  Å 3 . 
 6.8.1  Photooxidation 
 The cavitand - based capsule  F  has been applied by Gibb and Ramamurthy as a nanoreactor 
for the oxidation of methyl cycloalkenes by singlet oxygen to give allylic hydroperox-
ides. 50,51   Addition of a stoichiometric amount of ethyl cyclohexene  12  to the deep - cavity 
cavitand in a basic aqueous solution (which is necessary for capsule formation) resulted 
in formation of the host – guest complex, wherein nanoreactor  F  encapsulates two substrate 
molecules, i.e. [ F  ⊃    122] (Scheme  6.4 a). In the photooxidation reaction a singlet oxygen 
( 1 O 2 ) is added to the alkene bond and simultaneously one of the allylic hydrogens is 
abstracted, which can result in three different allylic hydroperoxides  13a ,  13b  and  13c 
(Scheme  6.6 a). Two different photosensitizers were used to generate singlet oxygen, 
namely the water soluble Rose Bengal (RB) or the water insoluble dimethyl benzil 
(DMB). In the later case, DMB was itself encapsulated within nanoreactor  F [ F  ⊃  DMB], 
 vide infra . Irradiation of [ F  ⊃    122] in the presence of photosensitizer RB or [ F  ⊃  DMB] 
yielded the allylic hydroperoxides  13a  and  13c  in 60 – 70% with 90 – 95% selectivity 
towards the regioisomer  13c . The products were isolated by extraction with chloroform.

photosensitizer RB) three hydroperoxides are formed,  13a (44%),  13b (20%) and  13c 
(36%). Thus, nanoreactor E exhibits very high regioselectivity in this particular oxidation 
reaction. NMR studies suggested that the methyl groups of the encapsulated substrates 
are anchored at the narrowest parts of the nanoreactor (Scheme  6.4 a). Hence, the encap-
sulated substrate is oriented such that singlet oxygen is prevented from approaching the 
methyl group. It is important to note that it is very difﬁ cult to control selectivity in reac-
tions with singlet oxygen. In addition, the NMR studies also support the observations that 
the allylic hydrogen H 3  of  12  is the most accessible of the three allylic hydrogen sets (H 3 , 
H 6  and H 7 ). Interestingly, nanoreactor  F  also stabilizes the product because the encapsu-
lated hydroperoxides [ F  ⊃  132] remained stable for weeks. 
 A very interesting aspect of this study is the use of the photosensitizer dimethyl benzil 
(DMB). This photosensitizer does not dissolve in water, unless it is encapsulated within 
nanoreactor  F , [ F  ⊃    DMB] (Scheme  6.6 b). It is important to notice that when [ F  ⊃  DMB] 
and [ F  ⊃    122] were mixed no guest exchange was observed and the capsules remained 
independent. The oxidation reaction of  12  involving [ F  ⊃    DMB] starts with the generation 
of excited DMB, i.e. [ F  ⊃     * DMB]. Next, the former nanoreactor opens and allows contact 
between oxygen and  * DMB, resulting in the formation of singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ). In a 
subsequent step, the singlet oxygen diffuses from [ F  ⊃  DMB] to [ F  ⊃  122], resulting in 
regioselective oxidation of  12 . This system has properties related to those important for 
biological signaling. 52

 6.9  Ligand Template Approach Using Lewis Acid/Base Interactions 
 Our own work in the area of supramolecular self - assembly and the application of cap-
sular structures for catalytic conversions has dealt mainly with the introduction and 
application of ligand - template approaches as a new strategy for the encapsulation of 
transition metal catalysts.  21 – 24,53   The template ligands have a bifunctional character in 
that they contain functional groups for capsule assembly as well as a donor - atom site 
for metal coordination. This results in the encapsulation of the metal within the ligand -
 template capsule. Tris(pyridyl)phosphines, P(Py) 3 , are privileged template ligands as the 
nitrogen atoms of the pyridyl groups selectively and strongly coordinate to Zn(II) -
 porphyrins or Zn(II) - salphens, [Zn], resulting in the ligand - template capsule  G , i.e. 
P(Py) 3  •  [Zn] 3 (Figure  6.7 a). 
 The zinc building blocks create a hemispherical capsule around the tris(pyridyl)phos-
phine. Subsequently, the phosphorus atom can coordinate to a transition metal such as 
Rh or Pd, resulting in selective encapsulation, i.e. [ G  ⊃    Rh or Pd] (this notation denotes 
that  G  encapsulates Rh or Pd). Addition of the zinc building blocks to the rhodium - 
bis - tris( meta - pyridyl)phosphine - complex, Rh(P( m - Py) 3 ) 2 (CO)(acac), creates sterical hin-
drance around the encapsulated metal and results in the facile dissociation of one of the 
two pyridylphosphine ligands to give [P( m - Py) 3  •  [Zn] 3  ⊃  Rh(CO)(acac)] i.e. [ G  ⊃  Rh(CO)

(acac)] (Figure  6.7 b). The encapsulated rhodium catalysts were shown to have unusual 
reactivity and regioselectivity in the hydroformylation reaction ( vide infra ). 
 We have also reported a ligand - template approach for metal encapsulation in which the 
ligand - template is an integrated part of the capsule.  54   This example involves a concave 
shaped bifunctional diphosphine ligand which can complexate a transition metal and also 
contains functional groups for capsule formation. Self - assembly of the tetracationic 
diphosphine ligand with a tetraanionic calix[4]arene leads to the formation of a reversible 
heterocapsule based on ionic interactions ( H ). Coordination of palladium to the template -
 ligand results in metal encapsulation [ H  ⊃  Pd – Ar] (Figure  6.8 ). 
 6.9.1  Hydroformylation 
 Transition metal catalysts encapsulated within the ligand - template nanoreactor  G , 
P(Py) 3  •  [Zn] 3 , have been applied to catalyze industrially relevant processes such as 
hydroformylation and Heck reaction. 22 – 24 Nanoreactor [ G  ⊃  Rh(CO)(acac)] encapsulates 
a Rh - species that contains only one tris( meta - pyridyl)phosphine ligand, P( m - Py) 3 , sur-
rounded by three Zn - porphyrins or Zn - salphens. Under syngas pressure (H 2 /CO), rhodium 
species like Rh(CO)(acac)P(Py) 3  transform into a complex of type HRh(CO) 3 P(Py) 3 , 
which is the active species for the hydroformylation reaction. In this reaction terminal 
alkenes are converted into linear and/or branched aldehydes, and the ratio of these prod-
ucts strongly depends on the speciﬁ c catalyst applied. Hydroformylation of 1 - octene by 
encapsulated rhodium, [ G  ⊃  HRh(CO) 3 ], resulted in a 10 - fold rate enhancement compared

Molecular Encapsulation
to the non - encapsulated rhodium catalyst (Scheme  6.7 a).  23,24   In addition, the selectivity 
for the product has reversed; nanoreactor [ G  ⊃  HRh(CO) 3 ] containing Zn(II) - porphyrins 
provides 63% of the branched aldehyde compared to 26% observed for the non - encapsu-
lated species. The unusual selectivity and increased rate can only partly be explained by 
modiﬁ cation of the catalytically active species upon encapsulation. Indeed, upon encap-
sulation the rhodium complex goes from bisphosphine to monophosphine, which gener-
ally produces more branched aldehydes along with higher rates compared to the 
bisphosphine species. In addition, a part of the effect was ascribed to complete encapsula-
tion of the catalyst, as open cage analogues containing only two porphyrins instead of 
three, and which were shown to also have only one phosphine ligand coordinated to the 
rhodium, proved less active and less selective toward branched aldehyde.   
 An advantage of the ligand - template approach for capsule assembly is the possibility 
to modify the shape of the capsule by only minor changes of the template - ligand, as 
demonstrated by using either tris( meta - pyridyl) - or tris( para - pyridyl)phosphine. Addition 
of Zn(II) - salphen scaffolds to these two ligand templates resulted in selective formation 
of nanoreactors  G and  I , respectively (Scheme  6.7 ). 23 Hydroformylation of 1 - octene by 
the tris( meta - pyridyl)phosphine based nanoreactor [ G  ⊃    Rh] gave a preference for the 
branched aldehyde (Scheme  6.7 a), whereas the tris( para - pyridyl)phosphine based nano-
reactor [ I  ⊃    Rh] predominantly gave the linear aldehyde, as with the non - encapsulated 
Rh – bisphosphine complex (Scheme  6.7 b). These selectivities imply that nanoreactor 
[ G  ⊃    Rh] corresponds to a Rh – monophosphine complex whereas the more open structure 
of nanoreactor [ I  ⊃  Rh] allows the formation of Rh – bisphosphine species. 
 More recently, nanoreactor [ G  ⊃    Rh] has operated as a high - precision catalyst for the 
regioselective hydroformylation of internal alkenes.  22 The non - encapsulated complex 
HRh(P( m - Py) 3 ) 2 (CO) 2  yields a near statistical mixture of the two expected internal alde-
hydes 2 - methyloctanal and 2 - ethylheptanal. However, nanoreactor [ G  ⊃  Rh], encapsulat-
ing the Rh - catalyst, exhibits a strong preference to form 2 - ethylheptanal in 88% (Scheme 
 6.8 ). This outstanding selectivity is unprecedented in the hydroformylation of internal 
alkenes. A similar selectivity was found in the hydroformylation of 3 - octene. Experiments 
using various partial H 2  and CO pressures resulted to the proposition that the hydride 
migration is the selectivity - determining step. This step requires a rotation of the coordi-
nated alkene which is hampered by the steric restrictions imposed by the interior of the

capsule. Apparently, rotation of the intermediate oleﬁ n complex leading to the 2 - 
ethylheptanal product is more facile, explaining the observed regioselectivity. Therefore 
it can be concluded that the nanoreactor determines the regiochemical outcome of the 
reaction by imposing its sterical restrictions during a speciﬁ c step in the catalytic sequence. 
It is interesting to note that there are no other reactions that can distinguish between the 
two carbon atoms of 3 - octene, demonstrating that reactions carried out in nanoreactors 
can result in unprecedented selective reactions. 
 In related work, we have employed   α  - diimine ligands with pyridine functionalities in 
conjunction with our Zn - porphyrin self - assembly protocol to arrive at supramolecular 
ligands for the Pd - catalyzed copolymerization of styrene and CO.  55   It was shown that 
both the reactivity of the catalyst and the stereoregularity of the polymer formed can be 
controlled in a supramolecular fashion, by subtle changes of the building blocks involved 
in the catalyst assembly. These supramolecular catalysts among the most active and selec-
tive catalysts for this reaction, and the origin of the selectivity is currently being studied. 
It is hypothesized that the effective encapsulation of the metal center by the porphyrin 
units has a signiﬁ cant impact on the overall dynamics of the system. 
 So far we have not used the chromophoric character of the porphyrin building blocks, 
but we recently studied systems in which we capitalize on these light capturing devices. 
We reported a catalyst system that is formed by assembly, which is able to use light as 
primary energy source to generate molecular hydrogen (Scheme  6.9 ).  56 The primary bio-
mimetic [2Fe2S] hydrogenase catalyst is utilized with supramolecular handles to assem-
ble the light capturing chromophore in close proximity of the active diiron centre to 
facilitate the photo - induced electron transfer. Importantly, closely related [2Fe2S] com-
plexes with very similar electrocatalytic properties show a distinctively different behavior 
upon (photo)reduction. For this reason the supramolecular approach has been important 
as it enables the easy modular variation of complexes. In addition, we found an active

( 15a  and  15b ) present in solution, suggesting that  14  •  ( 15a )( 15b ) is an active species. 
This study reconﬁ rms the observation that small changes in the parent [2Fe2S] complex 
can result in different and unpredictable reaction pathways upon reduction. The supramo-
lecular approach is highly promising for further development in this important area, as 
the modular nature of the building blocks applied also facilitates rapid optimization. 
 6.10  Virus Capsids, Proteins and Micellar Systems 
 Several approaches have recently been developed that directly apply natural architectures 
for artiﬁ cial chemical reactions, some of which are detailed in different chapters of this 
book. Although not classiﬁ ed as homogeneous catalysis, the reduction of metal salts 
inside nanoreactors could be the ﬁ rst step on the way to reactivity with the corresponding 
metal colloids or nanoparticles in e.g. hydrogenation reactions. A variety of carrier 
systems have been studied lately, including virus capsids, polymeric micelles, mini -
 emulsions and hollow core - shell particles, as nanoreactors and hosts for the synthesis and 
encapsulation of well - deﬁ ned, stable nanoparticles. 57 
 Viruses and proteins such as ferritin or streptavidin 58 are large self - assembled micellar 
aggregates of bio - amphiphiles that naturally function as carriers for RNA. Removal of 
this RNA core yields the corresponding  apo  - capsids that can be further functionalized. 
Hence, apoferritin has been used as a container for the formation of Cu and Ag nanopar-
ticles, by reduction of corresponding metal salts inside the virus capsid interior.  59 Also 
Fe - nanoparticles have been synthesized in a controlled manner within the cavity of geneti-
cally engineered human H - chain ferritin protein.  60   The groups of Nolte and Cornelissen 
have published initial results on the use of virus capsids as nanoreactors for single enzyme 
catalysis. 61

 6.11  Micellar Systems 
 Catalysis inside micellar systems is an attractive approach that might also ﬁ nd application 
in recycling and recovery of homogeneous catalysts, which would enable introduction to 
continuous catalysis. Besides covalent approaches, using crosslinked, unimolecular 
micelles or latex particles and electrostatic interactions between the surfactant head 
groups and the cationic metal species,  62 non - covalent, dynamic micelles charged with 
catalytically active transition metal complexes have also been employed. Recent examples 
include the work by Weberskirch on the dual - catalyst hydroaminomethylation of 1 - octene 
in aqueous media through the use of phosphane - functionalized macromonomers. 63 
Reasonable n/iso ratios of up to 11 and turnover frequencies of up to  ∼ 600 h  − 1 were 
obtained. In a similar fashion, micellar systems derived from 2 - oxaline based amphiphilic 
block - copolymers, partially functionalized with Co – salen complex at the hydrophobic 
interior, were used for the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of epoxides in water.  64 Excellent 
ee ’ s for both the epoxide and the diol product were obtained, but catalyst recycling experi-
ments showed loss in selectivity after a few runs. The droplets present in speciﬁ c inverted 
(water - in - oil) mini - emulsions have been employed as nanoreactors to perform a polymer-
ase chain reaction (PCR).  65   Micelles built - up in part from amphiphilic dendrons have been 
exploited as vessels for the aqueous - phase Diels – Alder addition reaction between C 60 and 
polycyclic hydrocarbons.  66   Inverted block - copolymeric micelles, featuring a poly(4 - vinyl-
benzoic acid) interior and a polystyrene corona in toluene, were utilized as hosts for 
Fe - bis(imino)pyridine based single - site alkene polymerization catalysis of ethene.  67 Rod -
 coil based amphiphiles, wherein the rod - fragment consisted of linear polyphenylene 
moieties and the coil - tail was represented by poly(ethylene glycol) chains, were shown 
to aggregate into micellar structures in water. The speciﬁ c architecture as well as the 
strict hydrophobic interior were shown to provide a good platform to perform the Suzuki 
coupling with standard aryl boronic acids and halides in water at room temperature 
at low catalyst loadings.  68   Our own group reported on functionalized, xanthene based 
diphosphine ligands that were decorated with surface - active pendant groups 
(i.e. - 4 - C 6 H 4 O(CH 2 ) n C 6 H 4 (SO 3 Na)), which spontaneously self - assembled into vesicular 
aggregates in water. These supramolecular structures proved stable even at elevated tem-
perature (90  ° C), so upon introduction of a suitable Rh - precursor, the selective aqueous 
biphasic hydroformylation of higher alkenes (e.g. octene), which typically show very low 
solubility in water, could be carried out, coupled with repetitive recycling of the catalyst 
system. 69 
 The groups of Rowan and van Hest have jointly reported on the use of polymersomes 
 –  enlarged liposomes with a vesicular structure containing a hydrophobic bilayer  – as 
nanoreactor vessels for a three - step cascade reaction.  70   The stepwise, controlled incorpo-
ration of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and glucose oxidase (GO) in separate inner -
 domains of the polymersome structure was conﬁ rmed by ﬂ uorescence microscopy. More 
speciﬁ cally, GO was selectively located inside the hydrophilic core enclosed by the 
bilayer, which itself contained HRP, whilst a third enzyme,  Candida antarctica  lipase B 
(CALB), was not encapsulated but was added to the bulk solvent surrounding the reactors. 
The following reaction sequence was studied as a proof - of - principle: i) conversion of 
1,2,3,4 - tetra - O - acetyl - β  - glucopyranoseglucose into glucose by CALB, ii) oxidation of 
glucose to the corresponding lactone concomitant with formation of H 2 O 2  by GO and iii)

lecular micelles, polymers and biomacromolecules the reader is referred to the recent

 6.12  Conclusions and Outlook 
 A wide array of self - assembled molecular capsules based on various building blocks and 
non - covalent interactions has been developed in the last decade. The nanospace within 
these supramolecular capsules is generally in the range of 300 – 500  Å 3  (although larger 
examples are known as well), which is sufﬁ cient for the selective encapsulation of appro-
priately sized guest molecule(s). A number of distinctly different capsule architectures 
have been characterized, highly dependent on the speciﬁ c type of non - covalent interac-
tion, building block structure and templating agent, and as a result guest shielding and 
guest exchange rates can strongly vary. A diversity of chemical processes has been carried 
out within molecular capsules and the effects observed so far are, although academic, 
very interesting. Reactions can be  accelerated  and the  selectivity  of a chemical process 
can be changed completely. These observations can be explained by stabilization of the 
reaction transition state by the capsule (based on enthalpic and entropic contributions) or 
by concentration effects in the case of bimolecular reactions, such as Diels – Alder reac-
tions. More important are the unique reaction  selectivities  induced by the novel ﬁ nite 
microenvironment within the capsule. The size and shape of the nanoreactor ’ s cavity and 
that of the nanoreactor ’ s gates can control the substrate selectivity by controlling the 
access to the cavity. Similarly, a nanoreactor can protect an  active site  located in the 
cavity that otherwise would be poisoned by chemicals present in solution. The  regio - and 
chemoselectivities can also be changed by the capsule, through a change in the relative 
reaction rates of competing pathways. This was for example observed for encapsulated 
rhodium complexes that were used as hydroformylation catalysts. In addition to these 
effects, reaction  intermediates , that otherwise exhibit too short lifetimes for identiﬁ cation, 
have been observed as stable species in nanoreactors. In these cases the reaction rate of 
the subsequent step after the formation of the intermediate is slowed down by the nano-
capsule.  Product inhibition , which is a frequently encountered problem in bimolecular 
coupling reactions carried out within enclosed cavities, is fundamentally related to the 
former. The coupling product might have a higher afﬁ nity for the capsule than the sub-
strates, and consequently product release from the nanoreactor becomes the slowest step 
in the reaction. Also entropic factors might be important, as a unimolecular product has 
to exchange with two substrate molecules. Product inhibition can prohibit the utility of 
nanoreactors as true catalysts. 
 In addition to the nanoreactors discussed in this review, which are formed by assembly 
of at least two building blocks, capsules based on covalent bonds have also been applied 
as nanoreactors.  11   Such covalent nanoreactors were beyond the scope of the current 
review, but similar effects in catalysis are observed. However, self - assembled capsules 
also have guest exchange mechanisms via partial disassembly of the capsule, whereas 
exchange for the covalent analogues is restricted to portal slippage. It is this unique 
property that enables the combination of complete encapsulation with sufﬁ ciently rapid

in – out exchange, which might proof to be very advantageous for potential catalytic 
applications. 
 Although the research ﬁ eld is still in its infancy, several examples of reactions, wherein 
self - assembled nanoreactors are applied and are shown to dramatic enhance or alter reac-
tivity, have appeared, thereby demonstrating the power of the supramolecular concept. 
Detailed studies are required to fully understand the mechanisms behind the effects 
observed when carrying out reactions in nanoreactors. The results obtained so far sketch 
a bright prospective, as reactions have been observed that are unique to those carried out 
in capsules. In this review we have focussed on reactions that take place  inside  the cap-
sules. However, molecular capsules have also been used to control reactions that take 
place  outside  the capsule for example by controlling the release of reagents, making the 
nanoreactor applications virtually unlimited. 71

 13.  An important difference between enzymes and nanoreactors is product release from the cavity. 
The Michaelis – Menten kinetics assumes that product release occurs rapidly (this assumption 
is also done in equation 4). However, this assumption does not always counts for nanoreactors 
because they can display product inhibition ( vide infra ).

 7.1  Introduction 
 7.1.1  Supramolecular Chemistry and Enzymes 
 Supramolecular Chemistry has been deﬁ ned as the chemistry beyond the molecule.  1 If 
you wish, any reaction, and especially catalysis, is a supramolecular phenomenon. The 
term supramolecular catalysis,  2   however, is used in a much more narrow sense. A good 
approach to avoid endless discussions on deﬁ nitions is to observe Mother Nature and look 
for supramolecular chemistry there. The molecular recognition of enzymes and their 
ability to catalyse numerous reactions with outstanding selectivities is a challenge for the 
(supramolecular) chemist. 
 What is so special about the enzymes? Which elements have to be copied if one wanted 
to construct an enzyme - like molecule? And what are the reasons to attempt a construction 
of an enzyme - like molecule? 
 Enzymes have been brought to perfection by billions of years of evolution. Nevertheless, 
enzymes for every conceivable reaction do not exist. A Diels – Alderase for instance has 
long been sought after, and even today there is dispute about its existence.  3 In addition, 
enzymes have been perfected in aqueous media, and usually only little variation in the 
solvent composition is possible. It is therefore attractive to copy the features of enzymes

and to construct artiﬁ cial molecules which may operate in any solvent and which may 
carry out reactions Nature has not taken into her reservoir of techniques. 
 For such enzyme - like molecules, two central features of an enzyme have to be imitated. 
First, there is a reactive site  –  the active site. This active site consists of one or more 
functional groups which, in many cases, may also carry out the same type of reaction if 
they are not part of an enzyme. But the selectivity, and also often the reactivity, will not 
be the same. Responsible for this aspect is the second important feature of enzymes, the 
embedding of the active site in the three - dimensional structure of the protein. The polypep-
tide backbone forms helices, sheets and other suprastructures which usually build up 
clefts, caves or niches in which the active site is located. This sterical shielding usually 
is responsible for the fascinating selectivities of enzymatic reactions. 
 The active site itself may just consist of the functional groups of the proteinogenic 
amino acids, or additional co - enzymes can be embedded. Many of them contain metal 
ions, and thus the enzymes can be divided into metallo - enzymes and metal - free ones. In 
the laboratory, bio - inorganic chemistry and organocatalysis try to understand and repro-
duce these two classes. 
 In this chapter, the geometric features will be the guide to enzyme - inspired artiﬁ cial 
systems. The vast majority of substrates have a shape which resembles that of a potato. 
In other words, their overall shape is convex and irregular. For a selective recognition of 
a surface, a multipoint interaction is necessary. Because the substrate is convex, the rec-
ognition region of the enzyme has to be concave which is ensured by a cleft or cave type 
geometry (see above). Host – guest recognition has been discussed since Emil Fischer  4,5 
established the lock - and - key principle. More elaborate models discuss ﬂ exible ﬁ t and 
induced ﬁ t, and conformational ﬂ exibility is essential in this context. But adaptability 
does not result in a loss of the concave shape. One way to ensure a general concave 
structure is the use of macrocycles, and another approach is to employ stiff subunits. The 
latter is realized in cleft molecules, also termed pincers, and within the group of macro-
cycles, especially bimacrocycles ensure concavity because they enclose the void in three 
dimensions. 
 For a reagent or a catalyst, a reactive functional group is needed. Inspired by the struc-
ture of enzymes, the functional group must be located in the concave region. The chal-
lenge is an  endo - functionalization. In 1987, 6   we presented the concept of concave reagents

in which we compared the geometry of a concave reagent with that of a light bulb in a 
lamp shade (Figure  7.2 ). The lamp shade represents the concave shielding, the light bulb 
the functional reactive group within this concave conﬁ nement. Next, the macroscopic 
features have to be translated into the nano - world. The rim of the lamp shade is a cycle, 
and in order to let molecules or part of a molecule pass, it must be macrocyclic. Then, 
the functional group must be placed above this entry which means that the macrocycle 
must be spanned by an additional bridge carrying the functional group. The last task is 
to ensure that the functional group remains in an  endo - position, and a lamp - like molecule 
is completed. 
 By turning the bimacrocycle upside - down, our concave concept was termed some years 
later as reaction bowls.  7   Functional groups including less stable ones such as a sulfenic 
acid, a selenenic acid, and a monosubstituted simple enol have been incorporated in 
cyclophanes and bridged calixarenes 8 (for an example see Figure  7.15 ). 
 7.1.2  Reagents and Catalysts 
 Over the past decades, numerous reactions have been carried out inside supramolecular 
complexes. In a large number of examples, no additional functional group was present in 
the cavity but the conﬁ nement and often the electrostatic potential was responsible for 
reactivity and selectivity. In contrast,  endo  - functionalized reagents and catalysts are active 
due to the embedded functional group. 
 Early examples for the ﬁ rst group of reactions are those in which a charge is developing 
or a charge is redistributed. Schmidtchen ’ s 9   tetrahedral trimacrocyclic tetracationic recep-
tors for instance accelerate the decarboxylation and ring opening of a benzisoxazole

(Figure  7.3 ) while Dougherty ’ s 10 anionic,   π  - rich macrocycles catalyse the alkylation of 
quinoline by stabilizing the charge in the transition state (Figure  7.4 ). 
 In the past decade, self - assembled cages have been made accessible for instance in the 
groups of Raymond,  11 Fujita 12 or Stang 13  . The resulting host molecules have now been 
used to catalyse reactions related to the ones mentioned above (Diels – Alder, 12 see Figure 
 7.5 , 3,3 - sigmatropic rearrangement, 11 see Figure  7.6 ). 
 In other host molecules, binding sites are located in such a way that the substrates or 
reagent and substrate are bound in proper proximity within a host molecule. The proximity 
is entropically favorable for a reaction and thus rate accelerations have been observed. In 
addition, the proper placement of the reactants leads to altered selectivities. For instance 
Sanders 14   described a macrocyclic trimeric porphyrin in which two substrates are preor-
ganized in such a way that the stereochemistry of a Diels – Alder reaction is governed by 
the inclusion (see Figure  7.7 ). 
 But most related to enzymes are those concave entities in which reactive functional 
groups are pointing inwards. Several subclasses can be identiﬁ ed: there are reagents and 
catalysts, and these can be divided into metal - containing and metal - free compounds.

 In the case of a reagent, a functional group is altered in the course of the reaction. An 
acid for instance can carry out a protonation which results in the corresponding base at 
the end of the reaction. Or a redox - reagent oxidizes or reduces a substrate and alters its 
redox state. This is a problem for expensive reagents like concave ones, and therefore 
recycling is essential in these cases (but easy to carry out in case of protonations/depro-
tonations or redox - reactions). 
 In catalysis, however, the catalyst is unaltered after each catalytic cycle. This means 
that much less material is needed if the catalysis has a good turn - over and that a recovery 
is possible, at least in principle. 
 Concave reagents have been employed in many reactions but for the reasons mentioned 
above, most of the reactions were catalyses. Besides acid or base catalyses, especially 
transition metal ion catalysed reactions are of interest and have been investigated. The 
following chapters will ﬁ rst present major classes of concave reagents and will then 
discuss some reactions and catalyses and the inﬂ uence of the concave shielding on rate 
and especially selectivity. 
 7.2  Classes of Concave Reagents 
 The ﬁ rst 6   examples for concave reagents were bimacrocyclic concave pyridines with the 
general structure shown in Figure  7.8 . A 2,6 - disubstitution of the pyridine was chosen in 
order to ensure the  endo  - position of the pyridine nitrogen atom ’ s lone pair. Later, the 
framework of the bimacrocycle has been changed,  15   and in principle, several approaches 
to concave pyridines, and to concave reagents in general, can be envisioned.

 7.2.1  Strategies for the Construction of Bimacrocycles 
 For a concave reagent with a lamp - like geometry, at least a bimacrocycle has to be con-
structed. Let us discuss a pyridine - containing bimacrocycle (see Figure  7.9 ). The synthetic 
task can be accomplished by two subsequent macrocyclizations with a monomacrocyclic 
intermediate (see Figure  7.9 , left and right), or in a double macrocyclization which gives 
the desired bimacrocycle from a non - macrocyclic starting material in one reaction step 
(see Figure  7.9 , middle). The two step reaction can be subdivided into two approaches. 
Either the pyridine is part of the starting material from the very beginning (Figure  7.9 , 
right), or a pyridine - free macrocycle is spanned by a pyridine - containing bridge (Figure 
 7.9 , left). 
 Although at ﬁ rst glance, the one - pot reaction may seem to be advantageous, all three 
methods have their pros and cons. In a double macrocyclization, two reactive ends are 
needed for the closure of each bridge, i.e. a total of four reactive ends exist in the precur-
sor. This implies a selectivity problem in the macrocyclization, because not only the 
desired bimacrocycle may be formed, also a  bis - monomacrocycle whose structure resem-
bles that of an earmuff is conceivable (see Figure  7.10 ). For several different classes of 
concave reagents, this problem has been investigated, but fortunately, only in the case of 
very long chains, the formation of an  ‘ earmuff ’  is a problem.  17 Therefore, many concave 
reagents may efﬁ ciently be built up using this strategy. 
 If the two - step syntheses for bimacrocyclic concave reagents are compared with one 
another, the use of a pyridine - free macrocycle as the starting material seems to be attrac-
tive because numerous macrocycles are easily available, some of which can even be 
purchased. Consequently, for instance calixarenes  18   have been spanned with pyridine (and 
other) bridges.  19   Although a very powerful ligand for a copper(I) catalyst has been found

 Figure 7.9   A bimacrocyclic pyridine can be constructed following three different 
approaches: (a) a non - macrocyclic precursor is doubly cyclized to give the bimacrocycle, 
shown in the middle, or (b) it can be built up stepwise. The left retrosynthesis represents 
the bridging of a X and Y containing macrocycle by a pyridine bridge while the right 
retro - synthesis starts from a pyridine - containing macrocycle

using this approach (see below),  20   the strategy is limited because the size of the starting 
macrocycle is preassigned in cases such as calixarenes or cyclodextrins. In the case of 
the bridged calixarenes, only the calix[6]arene derivative could be synthesized in good 
yield. 19   The respective calix[4] derivative did not form at all,  19   the calix[5] one was 
formed in low yield,  21   and with calix[8]arene, regioisomers were formed.  21 Furthermore, 
a ﬁ ne - tuning of the size of the macrocycle is not possible. 
 Therefore, also the third approach is useful. By synthesizing macrocyclic diamines ﬁ rst 
which were then bridged by a pyridine (or other) bridge, a large variety of bimacrocycles 
were formed and minute changes in the length and composition of the bridges were pos-
sible (see Figure  7.8 ). 6,16 
 Thus a pool of concave reagents has been made available using one or another of these 
three general strategies. Some of these molecules have been attached to dendrimers or 
polymers to allow easier recovery.  22,23 
 7.2.2  Ring - closure 
 The formation of macrocycles is well established but not as straightforward as the syn-
thesis of a ﬁ ve - or six - membered ring. 24 The latter ones possess almost no strain and are 
therefore formed much more easily than strained three -  or four - membered rings or 
medium size rings. However, macrocycles which contain more than twelve atoms usually 
are unstrained, too, still their synthesis is more difﬁ cult. The major competition to mac-
rocyclization is oligo -  and polymerization, and thus a number of methods had to be elabo-
rated to produce macrocycles in good yields. Two classes of syntheses must be 
distinguished: syntheses under thermodynamic control, and kinetically controlled ones. 
In a kinetically controlled macrocyclization, the rate of polymerization and cyclization 
differ in the reaction order. While (macro)cyclization is a unimolecular, ﬁ rst - order reac-

 metacyclophane (sometimes called  ‘ earmuff ’ , shown on the right), was not formed. The 
bimacrocyclic structure of the concave 1,10 - phenanthroline was conﬁ rmed by X - ray 
analyses  17

tion, oligo -  or polymerization take place between  two  molecules and thus these reactions 
are second - order in concentration of the precursors (see Figure  7.11 ). The latter reactions 
are therefore slowed down proportional to the square of the dilution while the macrocy-
clization of a single molecule is dilution independent. The respective rate only decreases 
linearly with dilution. This has been exploited by the high - dilution principles,  25 and 
several modiﬁ cations thereof have been worked out [e.g. one - component, two - component 
dilution, syringe pump technique]. The strong point of the kinetic control is the fact that 
a macrocycle, once it is formed, remains a macrocycle. 
 This is not the case in a thermodynamically controlled reaction. Thermodynamic 
control means that all compounds in the reaction mixture are in equilibrium, they con-
stantly are interconverted into one another. The relative ratio of the products depends on 
the relative thermodynamic stability of each compound. If the desired macrocycle is the 
most stable compound, ﬁ ne, but how can the concentration of a macrocycle be increased 
when it is not the global most stable product? It has to be forced to be a more stable 
compound. This can be done by adding an additional component which interacts with the 
desired macrocycle in such a way that the resulting complex is the most stable 
compound. 
 Such an approach uses the template effect, and by carefully adjusting the template to 
the macrocycle, the number of stabilizing interactions between the template and the 
desired product can be maximized while the number of interactions with starting materials

Already in the beginning of the history of concave reagents, the template effect of metal 
cations was utilized,  6   but also organic molecules can be applied. Sanders  30 for instance 
used the interaction of pyridines with zinc porphyrins in the construction of macrocyclic 
oligomeric porphyrins, and recently, the interaction between polyols and boronic acids 
has been used in order to synthesize new  endo - functionalized macrocycles (Figure  7.14 ). 31 
 Which reactions are useful for a ring - closing reaction? In principle, all reactions can 
be used. All irreversible reactions may be used in kinetically controlled cyclizations. 
However, it is advisable to use reactions which possess a decent reaction rate because the 
dilution and the potentially slow addition of one or more starting material to the reaction 
mixture lead to long reaction times anyway. Prominent reactions used for kinetically 
controlled macrocyclizations are nucleophilic substitutions as for instance found in 
Williamson ether syntheses (for an example see the product shown in Figure  7.10 ) or the 
formation of amides from acid chlorides and amines (see Figure  7.8 ). 
 For a dynamic combinatorial templated reaction, a reversible reaction is needed. 
Preferentially, a reaction is chosen whose reversibility can be switched on and off at wish, 
for instance by temperature or pH change or by the addition (and later removal or inhibi-
tion) of a catalyst. Also subsequent fast reactions can scavenge the macrocyclic reaction 
products. Prominent examples  26   for reversible reactions in macrocycle syntheses are 
disulﬁ de exchange, ester exchange, both pH controlled, ruthenium catalysed ring - closing 
metatheses or the formation of hydrazones and imines, the latter one usually being scav-
enged by reduction of the imines to respective amines. 
 7.2.3  Concave Acids, Bases and Ligands 
 Bimacrocycles synthesized by one of the strategies described above may contain func-
tional groups of different nature. First, basic centres were introduced,  6,15 – 17,19,32,33 next, 
complementary concave acids  34,35   were realized, and third, the lone pairs of the bases were 
utilized to coordinate a catalytically active metal ion.  17,36,37   But in principle, any kind of 
reactive group can be placed into the concave environment.  38   Just recently, the ﬁ rst 
concave N - heterocyclic carbenes have been realized. 39,40 Figures  7.15 – 7.21 summarize 
several classes of concave reagents and catalysts. As can be seen easily from the ﬁ nal 
structures, the different strategies yield products of different complexity. When a calix-
arene is spanned by a bridged or a tetrafunctionalized non - macrocyclic precursor is 
doubly cyclized, products with higher symmetry are formed than in the case of a stepwise

synthesis which starts from the building block containing the reagent. In addition, isomers 
may be formed such as conformers (in the case of carboxamides  6,16 ),  cis / trans - mixtures 
(when ring - closing metathesis 31,41   is used) or even regioisomers (when a larger calixarene 
such as calix[8]arene 21 is bridged). 
 As mentioned above, the objective of the concave shielding of a functional group in 
a concave reagent is selectivity: chemo - , regio - , diastereo -  and especially enantioselec-
tivity have to be controlled. To inﬂ uence the latter, chiral concave reagents are necessary. 
The usual way to turn a non - chiral compound into a chiral one is to add a stereogenic 
center, typically an asymmetrically substituted carbon atom. If applied to concave mol-
ecules there are two possible regions to attach it to. If attached to the inside of the 
cavity, the void becomes chiral but is ﬁ lled to a large part by this chiral substituent. But 
if attached to the outside, the concave inside remains mostly unaltered. Therefore axial 
chirality has been envisioned because it desymmetrizes the cavity without ﬁ lling it up.

 7.3  Reactions and Catalyses 
 As presented in the introduction, concave reagents can be used as reagents or as catalysts. 
As reagents they will be  ‘ used up ’  with the need of recycling, as catalysts they can carry 
out numerous catalytic cycles and can be recovered from the mixture. 
 7.3.1  Reagents 
 Due to the simple recycling, acid - base reactions, i.e. protonations or deprotonations, have 
been carried out successfully with concave reagents. There is no need to differentiate 
between acids and bases because for instance a protonated pyridine can transfer a proton 
in the same way as for example a carboxylic acid can. Much more important is the acidity 
of the corresponding acids. Respective p K a  values for the deprotonation have been deter-
mined in water (per deﬁ nition) but many reactions are carried out in various organic 
solvents (which is a strong point of concave reagents, see introduction).  47 The inﬂ uence 
of the solvent on acidity very often is enormous but at the same time this difference is 
frequently underestimated. If for instance the solvent water is exchanged by ethanol, the 
p K a  - analogous values of pyridines in ethanol hardly differ from the p K a  values in water.  16 
But for carboxylic acids, a drastic drop of several orders of magnitude can be observed 
when exchanging water by ethanol.  35   Consequently, less polar or even non - protic solvents 
may have an even more drastic effect on the relative acidities. In the pyridinium - carbox-
ylic acid comparison,  16,35   the discrepancy is extreme because for a pyridinium ion a charge 
is lost upon deprotonation while a carboxylic acid develops a charge when the anion is 
formed. And the less polar a solvent is, the more is the equilibrium shifted towards the 
uncharged particles, the base in the case of pyridine, the acid for carboxylic acids. 
 In protonations and deprotonations there are two fundamentally different pathways 
by which the proton can be transferred: the general and the speciﬁ c protonation. 48,49 The 
terms general and speciﬁ c have been coined for acid - catalysis  48   but they can be used 
for proton - transfers in the same sense.  49  General  means that generally (i.e. always) the

proton is transferred by the same particle, explicitly the protonated solvent. In contrast, 
a  speciﬁ c  protonation is carried out by a speciﬁ c proton donor, for instance a pyridinium 
ion or a carboxylic acid. A change in the proton source will therefore only have an 
inﬂ uence on the outcome of a protonation if the general protonation pathway is avoided. 
At ﬁ rst glance, the solution to this problem is the use of a hardly basic solvent and an 
acid of moderate acidity. However, there is a second problem in selective protonations. 
If the proton source shall have an inﬂ uence on the selectivity, the protonation must be 
kinetically controlled. A thermodynamic control would produce the more stable protona-
tion product and the protonating acid will ﬁ nally have no inﬂ uence on the product 
distribution. Unfortunately, the chance for a thermodynamically controlled protonation, 
an equilibrium, rises with increasing basicity of the corresponding base, and therefore 
a ﬁ ne balance must be found between acidities and basicities of all involved compounds. 
This may be the reason why only few examples exist for selective protonations, includ-
ing enantioselective ones.  50   In the case of concave reagents, concave proton donors have 
been used to carry out the Nef reaction under mild conditions  51   and for some stereose-
lective protonations. 52 
 7.3.2  Catalysts 
 Besides the use as a reagent, concave reagents can be used in a catalytic fashion. From 
the vast possibility of potential reactions, so far nucleophilic catalyses and metal catalyses 
have been investigated with several types of concave catalysts. 
 7.3.2.1  Organocatalysis 
 For nucleophilic catalyses, concave pyridines, concave 1,10 - phenanthrolines and concave 
NHC can be used. However, the substitution pattern which ensures the  endo - placement 
of the nucleophilic lone pair does not allow all kinds of nucleophilic catalyses. Pyridine 
and especially its more basic sibling DMAP [4 - (dimethylamino)pyridine] are excellent 
catalysts for acyl transfers. However the pyridine ’ s catalytic power drops enormously 
when substituents are added to the 2 -  and 6 - position.  53   A reaction which demands less 
space is the formation of a hydrogen bond to the lone pair of the nitrogen, and thus 
catalyses via hydrogen - bond formation are easily possible with concave pyridines. 
Speciﬁ cally, the activation of an alcohol by the formation of a hydrogen bond to the lone 
pair of a pyridine nitrogen atom in a concave environment has proven to be very valuable 
for selective acylations of these OH groups. An activated alcohol adds much faster to a

 Figure 7.23   The proton delivering agent for the protonation of a substrate can either be 
the acid H - A (speciﬁ c protonation) or the protonated solvent Solv - H + (general 
protonation). Only in the case of a speciﬁ c protonation can the acid inﬂ uence selectivity 
in the protonation step. But even in this case, a reversibility of the protonation, due to the 
basicity of the conjugate base of the acid, can ruin the controlled speciﬁ c protonation. In 
this latter case, the thermodynamically most stable protonation products will be observed

ketene than a free alcohol. Thus the use of pyridine, or related bases, can speed up the 
addition of alcohols to for instance diphenylketene. This ketene has been chosen because 
it is reactive enough in this addition reaction but still stable enough to be handled in 
normal laboratory practice.  54   This reaction allows to distinguish numerous alcohols,    17b,23,54 – 56 
and in the case of a glucose derivative with two very similar OH groups, one of them 
may be acylated in high yield exclusively. The concave shielding of the pyridine allows 
to discriminate between two secondary axial OH - groups (Figure  7.24 ). 56 
 More recently, concave NHC have been investigated as nucleophilic catalysts.  57 The 
catalytic potential of NHC is well known since Breslow  58   elucidated the mechanism of 
thiamine dependent enzymes.  59   With aldehydes, NHC may catalyse the benzoin condensa-
tion in the same way, a cyanide ion can. But when additional substrates are added, the 
nature of the NHC becomes important.  60   Thus, in a mixture of aldehydes and enals, two 
competing pathways may be catalysed and either so called Stetter products (for instance 
1,4 - diones) or   γ  - lactones can be formed (Figure  7.25 ). Using one particular concave NHC,

 7.3.2.2  Metal Catalysis 
 Probably the largest catalytic potential lies in the metal complexes of concave reagents. 
Two sub - structures are well established as metal ligands: 1,10 - phenanthroline and NHC. 
Numerous transition metal complexes have been synthesized  36,37,61,62   and some of them 
have been investigated in metal catalysed reactions such as Lewis - acid catalysed Diels –
 Alder reactions, 36 palladium - catalysed allylations, 63 and copper(I) - catalysed cyclopropa-
nations. 20,41,64   In the latter reaction, the full potential of concave reagents and the 
importance of the ﬁ ne structure of the concave shielding has become obvious. With two 
different types of concave ligands, two complementary stereoselectivities have been 
found. 
 When copper(I) catalysed, indene for instance reacts with diazoacetates to give either 
 exo - or  endo - cyclopropanes (see Figure  7.26 ). 20 The distinct difference in the selectivities 
achieved by using different concave 1,10 - phenanthrolines lies in the different geometry 
of the ligands. 
 In 2,9 - diaryl - 1,10 - phenanthrolines (see Figures  7.10 and  7.20 ), bridgeheads and 
1,10 - phenanthroline unit are connected directly, leading to a rather stiff entity. The active 
centre, the copper ion bound to the nitrogen atoms of the 1,10 - phenanthroline can only 
be reached from  ‘ below ’  through the bimacrocycle. In the cyclopropanation, the active 
species is a copper - carbenoid. When the alkene approaches it, the substituents of the 
alkene and the carboxylate of the carbenoid try to avoid sterical compression within the 
cavity and take up maximal distance to one another. Thus, the  exo - product is formed with 
high selectivity. 
 In contrast in the bridged calixarene (see Figure  7.15 ), the methyleneoxy units between 
the 1,10 - phenanthroline and the calixarene act as ﬂ exible joints and this leads to a differ-
ent geometry in which the 1,10 - phenanthroline bridge is tilted towards one chain of the 
calixarene rim. The calixarene macrocycle is too small to accommodate the carboxylate 
or to let an alkene approach the carbenoid. This results in an orientation in which both, 
the alkene and the carboxylate residue of the carbene moiety, have to be squeezed in the 
gap between the 1,10 - phenanthroline and part of calixarene rim. By this sterical shielding 
of the calixarene, the carboxylate and the residues of the alkene are oriented next to each 
other, and thus the predominant formation of the  endo - product is observed. 64b

[X  =  (CH 2 ) 10 ] in combination with  tert - butyl diazoacetate is highly  exo - selective

 The last decade has shown the increasing importance of N - heterocyclic carbenes as 
ligands for transition metals. In many complexes, the stabilization of special oxidation 
states of a transition metal is even better by a NHC than by phosphines, 65 the second 
generation of Grubbs ’  catalyst being a prominent example.  66   Also with concave NHC, 
many complexes can easily be prepared,  37,62   and some of them have been applied to 
catalyses. 62 Copper complexes may be used for cyclopropanations, too, but yet with 
smaller selectivities than 1,10 - phenanthrolines exhibit. With palladium however (see 
Figure  7.21 ), cross - coupling reactions such as Heck or Suzuki couplings can be carried 
out with good efﬁ ciency (Figure  7.27 ). 62 
 7.4  Summary and Outlook 
 The features of enzymes  –  active centre and concave shielding  –  have been combined 
in (usually) bimacrocyclic synthetic molecules. The resulting concave reagents can be 
used as reagents or preferentially as catalysts. In several reactions as for instance acyla-
tions or cyclopropanations, the concave reagents have demonstrated their selectivity -
 determining power. In current research, ﬁ rst chiral concave reagents have been 
synthesized and it is the task for the future to optimize the structures and to establish 
enantioselective reactions and catalyses. The similarity between concave reagents and 
enzymes, besides all advantages, produces one drawback. Indeed, by optimizing the 
concave geometry, selectivities can be tailored, but as with enzymes, a perfect reagent -
 substrate match leads to the problem that the optimized catalyst is only perfect for the 
substrate it was optimized for. In enzyme chemistry there exists an exaggerated saying: 
 ‘ one enzyme, one substrate ’ . In this respect, concave reagents cannot surpass enzymes. 
The higher the selectivity, the smaller is the substrate tolerance. But concave reagents 
can be made from any starting material. The backbone of the bimacrocyclic structure 
is not restricted to amino acids. And thus concave reagents can be made more robust, 
for any solvent, for higher temperatures. In addition, also the functional groups are not 
restricted to those found in enzymes. The guideline for the future is therefore: try to

copy the excellency of enzymes as much as possible but try to use optimized backbones 
and any functional group. 
 So far, most approaches to enzyme - like activity have used just one of the functional 
groups which are present in enzymes. However, many enzymes only operate by a coop-
eration of functional groups (see for instance the catalytic triade in peptidases). There, 
the enzyme ’ s functional groups perform a multifunctional catalysis. Therefore in (organo)
catalysis, bifunctional catalysis has been developed, too.  67 In the ﬁ eld of concave reagents, 
ﬁ rst bifunctional catalysts have been constructed (Figure  7.28 ),  41e   and future will tell how 
capable they are to catalyse reactions with their acidic  and basic functionalities.

last century, the template effect has been used for a much longer time. Some of the best

their synthesis had not implied the template effect. Probably the ﬁ rst example of a metal ion

 8.1  Introduction 
 Calixarenes are oligomeric cyclophanes derived from the condensation of phenols with 
formaldehyde. They became popular in the late seventies and have played a very impor-
tant role in Supramolecular Chemistry ever since, as witnessed by numerous books 1 and 
review articles  2   on the subject. Calixarenes are important building blocks for the prepara-
tion of a large variety of supramolecular complexes and materials, thanks to their ability 
to act as hosts, and the possibility of introducing a large number of functions at either 
rim by means of selective derivatization. 
 This chapter focuses on reactivity control in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions 
taking place in the conﬁ nes of supramolecular complexes of reactants with calixarene 
receptors. Earlier work on the subject was reviewed by us in 2000.  3 Quite recently, 
Homden and Redshaw have published an extensive review on the use of calixarenes in 
metal - based catalysis. 2i   Because of space limitations and, even more importantly, to avoid 
extensive overlap with the already reviewed material, the scope of this chapter is restricted 
to works treated only marginally, or not treated at all, in the above review article. The 
ﬁ rst section deals with examples in which reactivity control takes place via substrate 
inclusion into the calixarene cavity. The other section illustrates the use of the calix[4]
arene upper rim in the construction of di -  and trimetallic complexes capable of esterase 
and nuclease activity.

 8.2  Calixarenes as Hosts 
 The limited size of the calix[4]arene backbone allows deep penetration within its cavity 
of only small guests. Notably, Rathore, Kochi and co - workers  4   reported that the tetra -  O -
 methylated  p - tert - butylcalix[4]arene  1 (R − Me), upon oxidation in CH 2 Cl 2  followed by 
exposure to gaseous NO, or upon treatment with NOSbCl 6 , forms a dark purple, highly 
stable 1  :  1 complex ( K  >  5  ×  10 8  M  − 1 ), that shows no sign of decomposition for several 
months, both in solution and in the solid state. The X - ray structure showed that NO + is 
completely entombed in the cylindrical cavity of the 1,3 -  alternate  conformation.  1 H NMR 
spectroscopic evidence was obtained that in solution all four conformers ( cone ,  partial 
cone , 1,2 - alternate , 1,3 - alternate ) of the calix[4]arene host form complexes of deﬁ nite 
stability with NO + . The preference of 1,3 -  alternate  in the solid state indicates a crystal-
lization induced drainage of the equilibria in solution. Rudkevich  et al . 5,6 subsequently 
discovered that caged NO +  complexes of the same kind are reversibly formed upon bub-
bling NO 2 /N 2 O 4  through a chloroform solution of a tetra -  O - alkylated calix[4]arene ( 1 , 
R − Hex) ﬁ xed in the 1,3 - alternate conformation, in the presence of SnCl 4 (Equation  8.1 ). 
Quite remarkably, encapsulated NO +  was found to act as a highly selective nitrosating 
agent towards secondary amides. The reaction mechanism outlined in Scheme  8.1 is 
consistent with the observed size - shape selectivity and with the ﬁ nding that the chemical 
properties of encapsulated NO +  are different from those in bulk solution, and are control-
led by the calix[4]arene cavity. The reaction proved to be quite sensitive to the size of 
 – Alk, but not to that of  – Alk ′ . Fair to good yields (50 – 95%) of  N - nitrosated products 
were obtained only with  N  - methylated amides, independent of the size of  – Alk ′ from 
ethyl to heptyl. No reaction occurred with amides alkylated with  – Alk bulkier than methyl, 
on account of the hindered approach to the encapsulated NO + species.

 The wider cavity of calix[6]arene has been masterfully exploited by the group of 
Reinaud in the design of ligands that mimic the coordination sphere of the metal ion of 
copper enzymes.  7   A calix[6]arene functionalized at the smaller rim by three independent 
 N  - donor groups, upon binding to copper is constrained in a  cone  conformation. The free 
coordination site of the metal situated inside the calix[6]arene cavity is available for 
coordination to small donor molecules to afford the so - called  ‘ funnel complexes ’ . 8 
Structure  2  shows a funnel complex featuring a tris(pyridine) coordination site, a perfectly 
tetrahedral geometry for cuprous ion, and a CH 3 CN ligand embedded in the calix[6]arene 
cavity. A preliminary investigation of the electrochemical behaviour of a tris(pyridine) –
 calix[6]arene – Cu complex 9a   was extended to additional families of Cu – N 3 – calix[6]arene

complexes including tertiary amine and  N - alkylimidazole ligands. 9b The important dis-
covery was made that the electrochemical behaviour of the complexes could be resolved 
and analyzed in CH 3 CN, but not in non - coordinating solvents such as CH 2 Cl 2 and THF. 
The beneﬁ cial action of CH 3 CN was obviously ascribed to its ability to form funnel 
complexes. The supramolecular concept of the  ‘ shoetree ’  molecule guest was proposed. 
The  ‘ shoetree ’ CH 3 CN guest in the calix[6]arene cavity ensures the overall ﬁ xation of the 
coordination at every stage of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) reorganization process. As such, the  ‘ shoe-
tree ’ guest is a prerequisite for a dynamic redox behaviour. 
 Another family of calix[6]arene funnel complexes is provided by the calixtren ligand 
 3 . 10   Here a calix[6]arene is capped by a tren unit, thereby presenting a  N 4 coordination 
site at the end of a concave calix[6]arene core. Calixtren – Cu complexes are endowed with 
unique properties, when compared to all previously described tren – Cu complexes. The 
 3 – Cu(I) complex does not disproportionate in concentrated solution, and is stable in 
chlorinated solvents for days. Furthermore the  3 – Cu(II) complex is a strong receptor for 
neutral ligands, such as nitriles, alcohols and amides, but not for anionic ligands. This 
was ascribed to the strong electrostatic repulsion exerted by the lone pairs of the six 
oxygen atoms of the calix[6]arene core. Unlike the Cu(I) complexes of the calix[6]arene -
 based ligands equipped with tris(imidazole) or tris(pyridine) coordination sites, the cal-
ixtren - complexed Cu(I) centre in  3 – Cu(I), was found to be very sensitive towards O 2 
(Scheme  8.2 ), leading to a transient (CuO 2 ) +  species, whose nature was assigned as a 
reactive Cu(II) – superoxide adduct. In the presence of CH 3 CN, well suited for penetrating 
the calix[6]arene cavity and for stabilizing the Cu(II) centre,   O2
− is ejected from the 
complex into the reaction medium. Even more importantly, in a non coordinating solvent 
such as CH 2 Cl 2  the metal - bound superoxide species directly oxidizes a CH bond of the 
tren backbone, a result that has important implications for the modes of action of copper 
monooxygenases.

 The  p - sulfonatocalix[n]arenes  4 , originally synthesized by Shinkai  et al . 11 as water 
soluble calixarenes for catalytic studies in water solution, were more recently used by 
Ueoka  et al . 12   as catalysts in the speciﬁ c acid catalyzed methanolysis of  N - Ac - l - amino 
acids (Phe, Tyr, Trp, His, Lys, Arg). Rates of methanolysis in the presence of the calix[n]
arene catalysts, normalized per sulfonic group, were compared with rates obtained in the 
presence of the noncyclic analogue  p - hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid. Rate enhancements 
 –  ranging from 12 -  to 86 - fold  –  relative to control were recorded only in the methanolysis 
of basic amino acid derivatives (His, Lys, Arg), but neutral amino acid derivatives (Phe, 
Tyr, Trp) responded virtually in the same way to the presence of cyclic and non - cyclic 
catalyst. Michaelis – Menten kinetics and  1 H NMR spectral evidence pointed to the inter-
mediacy of inclusion complexes of  4  with the protonated form of basic amino acid deriva-
tives, as shown in  5 for the His – 4 (n  =  4) combination. 
 
 
 Ditopic receptors  6  were designed and synthesized by de Mendoza  et al . 13a as mimics 
of the phosphocholine binding site of McPC603 antibody. Receptors  6  bind strongly to

roform, 25  ° C), as a result of a combined binding of the choline trimethylammonium head 
to the calix[6]arene subunit through cation – π  interactions, and of the anionic phosphate 
to the guanidinium subunit through ion pairing and hydrogen bonding. Since phosphate 
diesters are well known transition state analogues for the basic hydrolysis of esters, it was 
reasoned that receptors  6  would catalyze a B Ac 2 - type cleavage of choline esters. Indeed, 
the methanolysis of choline  p  - nitrophenyl carbonate (PNPCC), in CHCl 3 /MeOH 99  :  1 in 
the presence of diisopropylethylamine – perchlorate salt buffer at 25    ° C (Equation  8.2 ) was 
effectively catalyzed with turnover by  6 . 13b   A rate enhancement of 76 - fold relative to 
background was recorded in the presence of 1   mM  6a , and one of 149 - fold in the presence 
of 1  mM  6b . Kinetic analysis yielded maximum rate accelerations at saturation of 600 
and 1000 for  6a  and  6b , respectively. Much lower rate enhancements were brought about 
by equimolar mixtures of the disconnected subunits, showing that the two subunits in  6 
bind to the transition state  7 with considerable degree of synergism.
 
 
  (8.2) 
 A similar strategy of catalyst design based on ditopic receptors composed of distinct 
recognition elements for the reacting and non - reacting parts of the substrates, was adopted 
by the group of Rebek in a number of works involving reactions of choline or choline 
derivatives. In these studies, the recognition subunit for the choline trimethylammonium 
head is a cavitand derived from resorcinol.  14 Receptor  8  features a zinc(II) salophen unit 
fused to a resorcinarene. As suggested by an energy minimized structure, the trimethylam-
monium group of a PNPCC guest is well positioned deep within the cavity, whereas the 
ester carbonyl is simultaneously coordinated to the metal electrophile. In accordance with 
this picture, PNPCC has a very high afﬁ nity for  8 , much higher than that of choline. The 
complexed PNPCC undergoes basic hydrolysis in buffered CH 2 Cl 2  containing 0.01% 
water (Equation  8.3 ) no less than 50 times more rapidly than uncomplexed PNPCC. 
Consistent with a complexation catalysis scheme, the much less reactive acetylcholine 
acts as a competitive inhibitor in the hydrolysis of PNPCC. Complex cavitand  8  is also 
an effective catalyst for the acylation of choline. 15 Here the salophen - complexed metal

ion is believed to activate the incoming acylating agent toward nucleophilic attack from 
the cavitand - complexed choline hydroxyl. In the presence of 2   mol% of  8 , the reaction 
with acetic anhydride (Equation  8.4 ) takes place 1900 times faster than the background 
reaction. Acetylation is an order of magnitude slower when the zinc(II) – salophen complex 
and the cavitand unit are not covalently connected.

 As a variation on the theme, instead of a zinc(II) – salophen unit, receptor  9 16 features 
a 2 - pyridone unit, that is a known bifunctional catalyst for the rate limiting breakdown 
of the tetrahedral intermediate involved in the aminolysis of active esters in aprotic sol-
vents. Turnover catalysis was indeed observed when the reaction between propylamine 
and PNPCC (Equation  8.5 ) was carried out in CH 2 Cl 2 /CH 3 CN 99  :  1 in the presence of 
receptor  9 . It was estimated that the reaction inside  9  is  ca . 6000 times faster than the 
reaction in the bulk solvent.

groups, when deeply hosted in the cavity of  10 , position the maleimide carbonyl group 
in close proximity to the organized  H  - bonding network, whereas the double bond remains 
exposed above the receptor. The Diels – Alder reaction of the complexed maleimide with 
9 - anthracenemethanol (Equation  8.6 ) is strongly accelerated relative to the reaction of the 
uncomplexed reactant. This is believed to arise from interaction of the dienophile with 
the hydrogen bonding network at the cavitand rim. The hydroxyl of 9 - anthracenemethanol 
plays a role, because anthracenes lacking a hydroxyl group do not react. The increase in 
steric bulk of the reaction product causes fast release from its complex with  10 , thus 
ensuring high turnover efﬁ ciency with little or no product inhibition.

azepane (7 - ring) and azocane (8 - ring) in the non - polar solvent  p - xylene - d 10 (Equation 
 8.7 ). 18 The afﬁ nity for the host is low with piperidine ( K  =  14  M  − 1 ) and is somewhat higher 
with the larger rings ( K  =  40  M  − 1 ). When carried out in the presence of stoichiometric  10 , 
the reaction of piperidine with the activated aryl chloride shows a 12 - fold rate enhance-
ment relative to the control reaction. Seven -  and eight - membered cyclic amines, whose 
afﬁ nity for the host is somewhat higher, show accelerations of 67 - and 35 - fold, respec-
tively. These were proposed to arise from the ability of the polar amide groups at the 
upper rim to stabilize the anionic portion of the dipolar transition state, possibly combined 
with cation – π  interactions between the aromatic walls of  10  and the developing positive 
charge of the nucleophilic nitrogen.
