 Resorcinarene - based deep cavitands were also used by Rebek and coworkers to stabi-
lize and detect otherwise elusive reaction intermediates. The entropically favoured reac-
tion of primary amines hosted in the cavity of  12  with the introverted aldehyde functionality 
(Scheme  8.3 ) leads to previously undetectable hemiaminal intermediates, whose half - lives 
vary from 30  min to 100  h. 20   The nature of the stabilization arises from a combination of 
mechanical isolation from the medium, hydrogen bonding to the organized amide seam 
at the cavitand rim, and steric repulsion between the alkyl group and the cavitand wall 
occurring for the repositioning of the alkyl group when going from hemiaminal to imine, 
as schematically shown in Scheme  8.3  for the reaction of  i - propylamine. The hemiaminal 
derived from  i  - propylamine has a half - life of 135 minutes, whereas half - lives lower by 
an order of magnitude are observed for hemiaminals derived from unbranched pro-
pylamine and butylamine. The exceptionally long lifetimes of the hemiaminals derived 
from ethanolamine (t  ½   =  3520  h) and ethylenediamine (t  ½   =  5640  h) are due to further 
stabilization arising from intramolecular hydrogen bond.

 A similar strategy was adopted for the observation of elusive isoimide inter mediates.  21 
The reaction between a carboxylic acid and an aliphatic isonitrile in mesitylene - d 12 
(Equation  8.9 ) proceeds through an isoimide intermediate that rearranges to a  N -
 acylformamide (Mumm rearrangement). When cavitand  13  was reacted at millimolar 
concentrations with isopropyl isonitrile in mesitylene -  d 12 ,  1 H NMR peaks and IR bands 
arising from the isoimide intermediate were detected. Over the course of a few hours, the 
signals arising from the intermediate disappeared and were replaced by signals from the 
 N  - acylformamide product. Again, stabilization by supramolecular interactions and steric 
barriers to Mumm rearrangement due to restricted molecular motions in the interior of 
the cavity, explain the slow rate of decomposition of the isoimide intermediate.

 Molecular capsules are structurally elaborated receptors that completely surround the 
hosted molecule(s). Encapsulation based on covalent bonds yields permanent arrange-
ments of molecules - within - molecules. 22   Reversible encapsulation, on the other hand, is 
based on self - assembling through formation of weak supramolecular bonds and offers 
possibilities for a dynamic   in
out

 exchange of encapsulated molecules. Most of the 
dimeric capsules developed by Rebek and his group are obtained through reversible self -
 assembly of resorcinarene subunits. When simultaneously encapsulated in the cylindri-
cally shaped inner space of these capsules, two reactant molecules are temporarily isolated 
from others in solution and display reactivity features different from those in bulk solu-
tion. The matter has been extensively reviewed, 23 and will not be discussed here.

complexes. In many instances such dinuclear complexes have been obtained from homo-
ditopic receptors composed of two identical metal complexing units connected by a suit-
able spacer. The catalytic efﬁ ciency of these complexes is inﬂ uenced by a variety of 
factors, among which the nature of the spacer itself plays an important role. The use of 
either rim of calix[4]arenes as suitable spacers is well precedented.  3 Particularly success-
ful has been the use of the upper rim of calix[4]arenes blocked in the  cone conformation, 
that was pioneered by the group of Reinhoudt.  25   Dinuclear zinc(II) and copper(II) com-
plexes of ditopic receptors composed of two nitrogen ligand units at the diagonal position 
of a calix[4]arene scaffold, showed a high degree of catalytic cooperation of the two metal 
centres in the cleavage of phosphodiester bonds, as a result of a good compromise between 
preorganization and ﬂ exibility (dynamic preorganization).  25   Most recent investigations in 
this area, resulting from joint efforts involving the authors ’  group in Roma, Reinhoudt ’ s 
group in Enschede, and Ungaro ’ s group in Parma, are summarized in this section. These 
studies were aimed at widening the scope of the calix[4]arene scaffold in the construction 
of di - and trinuclear catalysts capable of esterase and nuclease activity. 
 8.3.1  Artiﬁ cial Esterases: Barium(II) Complexes 
 The basic ethanolysis of esters functionalized with a distal carboxylate anchoring group 
is catalyzed with turnover by dinuclear barium complexes according to the mechanism 
depicted in Scheme  8.4 . 26 The high afﬁ nity of carboxylate for the ligated barium ion 
ensures efﬁ cient binding of the ester substrate to the metal catalyst. The function of 
the anchoring step is manifold: it selects the substrate, provides a moderate electronic 
activation to the ester undergoing nucleophilic attack, and transforms an otherwise inter-
molecular ethoxide delivery to the ester carbonyl into an intramolecular one.

 The catalytic efﬁ ciencies of regioisomeric complexes  14 – Ba 2  and  15 – Ba 2  in the basic 
ethanolysis of esters  18 – 21  are compared in Table  8.1  with that of the dinuclear barium 
complex of the closely related ligand  16 , as well as with that of the mononuclear control 
 17 – Ba. 27   Rate measurements refer to conditions where no less than 90% of the ester is 
bound to the catalyst in the productive (Michaelis) complex  II (Scheme  8.4 ), while the 
concentration of the unproductive 2  :  1 complex  III  is negligibly low. The superiority of 
dinuclear catalysts over the mononuclear counterpart demonstrates that the two metal ions 
work in a cooperative fashion, in accordance with the bifunctional catalytic mechanism 
in Scheme  8.4 , but the extent of cooperation is strongly dependent on the catalyst – 
substrate combination. This is not really surprising, as the catalytic mechanism implies 
that the substrate and the catalyst must form a well matched pair in terms of size and 
geometrical features. A convenient comparison of catalytic performances of regioisomeric

 14 – Ba 2 and  15 – Ba 2  complexes, and of the analogous  m - xylylene derivative  16 – Ba 2 is 
carried out in terms of effective molarities ( EM s). 23b   Since the bimetallic catalysts trans-
form an otherwise intermolecular reaction between ester and ethoxide ion into an intramo-
lecular one, the  EM  notion, deﬁ ned by the ratio k intra /k inter (Scheme  8.4 ), strictly applies 
to the catalytic processes at hand. The  EM  provides an absolute measure of the efﬁ ciency 
of the intramolecular catalytic step, that is independent of the intrinsic reactivity of end 
groups. Unlike the catalytic rate enhancement and the advantage of dinuclear over mono-
nuclear catalyst, the  EM  is independent of reactant concentrations, and its numerical value 
is solely determined by the usual choice of molarity as concentration unit. 
 Plots of  EM vs. the carboxylate - carbonyl distances in the ester substrates, taken as a 
gross measure of their size, are shown in Figure  8.1 . It is apparent that the dinuclear cata-
lyst  14 – Ba 2 , in which the azacrown units are linked to vicinal positions of the calix[4]
arene scaffold, is not only far superior to its diagonal regioisomer  15 – Ba 2  in all cases, 
but it is also superior to  16 – Ba 2  in the reactions of esters  18 – 20 . The  EM proﬁ le shows 
that the catalytic efﬁ ciency of  14 – Ba 2  reaches its maximum value in the reaction of ester 
 19 , and drops to a very low value in the reaction of the  ‘ longest ’  ester  21 . This indicates 
that  14 – Ba 2  cannot expand its intermetal distance to ﬁ t the long carboxylate - carbonyl 
distance in  21 . In conclusion, reactivity data obtained for the various catalyst – substrate 
combinations indeed show that a close ﬁ t of ester size to metal - to - metal distance is an 
important prerequisite for catalysis. However, the marked superiority of  14 – Ba 2 over 
 15 – Ba 2  with all of the esters can hardly be ascribed to a more suitable intermetal distance 
in the former. This indicates that in addition to intermetal distance, still poorly understood 
effects may contribute signiﬁ cantly to catalytic efﬁ ciency of dinuclear metal catalysts. 
 8.3.2  Artiﬁ cial Esterases: Zinc(II) Complexes 
 The zinc(II) complex of 2,6 - bis[(dimethylamino)methyl]pyridine (BAMP) is catalytically 
active in the methanolysis of esters at pH 10.4.  28   Rate enhancements (Table  8.2 ) brought 
about by BAMP – Zn 28,29   are much higher for the carboxylate decorated esters  19 – 22 than 
for the parent phenyl acetate  23 , because binding to the metal ion transforms the moder-
ately electron - releasing (rate - retarding) carboxylate into an electron - withdrawing (rate -
 enhancing) one. In the reactions of  23 , moderate differences in rate - enhancements among 
mono - , bi - , and trimetallic complexes indicate that the various metal centres act essen-
tially as independent non - cooperative catalytic units. In marked contrast to the behaviour 
of phenyl acetate  23 , the reactions of the carboxylate - decorated esters are in many cases 
catalyzed by dinuclear complexes  24 – Zn 2  and  25 – Zn 2  much more strongly  –  4 orders of

magnitude in the most favourable cases  –  than by mononuclear BAMP – Zn. 28,29 This is 
consistent with a bifunctional catalytic mechanism (Figure  8.2 ) in which one of the metal 
ions serves as a docking site for the carboxylate, and the other delivers an activated 
methoxide to the ester function. In the reactions catalyzed by the 1,2 - vicinal complex 
 24 – Zn 2 , the extent of cooperation of the two metal centres is quite high for esters  22 and 
 19 , signiﬁ cantly lower for ester  20  and even lower for ester  21 . Clearly, catalyst  24 – Zn 2 
experiences an increasing difﬁ culty to ﬁ t the altered substrate in the transition state when 
the ester size exceeds that of  19 . A similar trend of reactivity is seen in the reactions 
carried out in the presence of the less effective catalyst  25 – Zn 2 . In this case, however, 
there is no sign of cooperation between metal centres in the reactions of  20 and  21 . 
 The marked superiority of the 1,2 - vicinal complex  24 – Zn 2  over its distal regioisomer 
 25 – Zn 2  closely parallels that observed in the basic ethanolysis catalyzed by dinuclear 
complexes  14 – Ba 2  and  15 – Ba 2  (Table  8.1 ). The results obtained in the basic methanolysis 
of esters catalyzed by the zinc(II) complexes of calix[4]arenes  28 – 31  decorated with 
1,5,9 - triazacyclododecane ([12]aneN 3 ) ligands fully conﬁ rm the superiority of 1,2 - 
vicinal bimetallic catalysts over their distal regioisomers.  30   Thus, the order of catalytic 
efﬁ ciency 1,2 - vicinal  >>  1,3 - distal appears to be a substrate - independent feature of upper 
rim calix[4]arene - based bimetallic catalysts for the cleavage of carboxylate - functional-
ized esters, which is unaffected by the nature of the metal ion and of the corresponding 
ligating unit. 
 Kinetic data obtained in the reactions catalyzed by the BAMP ligated zinc complexes

 EM  data are plotted in Figure  8.3  together with available data related to the basic 
ethanolysis catalyzed by dinuclear complexes  14 – Ba 2  and  15 – Ba 2 . The superiority of both 
 14 – Ba 2  and  15 – Ba 2  to the structurally related  24 – Zn 2  and  25 – Zn 2  indicates a lower adapt-
ability of the zinc(II) complexes to the altered substrates in the transition state, which is 
believed to arise from more stringent requirements of the coordinative interactions of a

 The highest catalytic activity in the methanolysis of esters  18 – 22  is exhibited in most 
cases by trinuclear complexes. In principle, a trinuclear complex could work as a dinuclear 
complex, with the third metal ion acting as a spectator. In  26 – Zn 3  and  31 – Zn 3  there are

 distal bimetallic complexes is very low, the activity of trimetallic complexes may be 
thought as the sum of contributions arising from two 1,2 - vicinal bimetallic arrangements. 
The statistical advantage of  26 – Zn 3 ( 31 – Zn 3 ) over  24 – Zn 2 ( 29 – Zn 2 ) is 2 under subsaturat-
ing conditions, but reduces to 4/3 under saturating conditions.  30 Thus, the statistical 
advantage of a trimetallic complex over its 1,2 - vicinal bimetallic analogue should lie 
somewhere between 2 and 1.3, most likely closer to the lower limit because either set of 
catalytic experiments was carried out under conditions not far from saturation. The ﬁ nding 
that  26 – Zn 3  is about four times as effective as  24 – Zn 2  in the cleavage of  19 (Table  8.2 ) 
provides a strong indication of the cooperation of three metal ions in the catalytic mecha-
nism. Efﬁ cient cooperation of three metal ions (Zn, Cu) in the cleavage of phosphodiesters 
was reported in a number of studies  25,31   but, to the best of our knowledge, trimetallic 
catalysis in ester cleavage is unprecedented. 
 The proposed mechanism depicted in Figure  8.2  emphasizes the three different func-
tions performed by the metal ions: ( i ) substrate recognition through binding to carboxy-
late, ( ii ) Lewis - acid activation of the ester carbonyl, and ( iii ) nucleophile delivery. We 
further note that  k obs ( 26 – Zn 3 )/ k obs ( 24 – Zn 2 )   =   2.4 in the cleavage of  20  (Table 2), and that 
 k obs ( 31 – Zn 3 )/ k obs ( 29 – Zn 2 )   =   2.4 also in the cleavage of  22 . 30   It appears therefore that there 
are small, but higher than statistical advantages of trinuclear over 1,2 - vicinal dinuclear 
catalysts, which might be taken as an indication of a modest contribution from the third 
metal ion. 
 8.3.4  Artiﬁ cial Nucleases: Zinc(II) Complexes 
 Efﬁ cient catalysis of HPNP transesteriﬁ cation (Equation  8.10 ) arising from synergic 
action of the two metal centres was reported in previous studies  25   for the dinuclear zinc(II) 
complex of BAMP functionalized calix[4]arene  25 . In marked contrast to what observed 
on the catalytic cleavage of esters (Table  8.2 ), the 1,2 - vicinal complex  24 – Zn 2 was 
subsequently found  28   to be signiﬁ cantly less effective than its 1,3 - distal regioisomer 
 25 – Zn 2 .
 
 
 
 (8.10) 
 A major limitation of the BAMP functionalized catalysts is the limited solubility in 
water, that requires the use of an organic cosolvent. Another limitation is the afﬁ nity of 
BAMP for zinc(II), that is large enough for catalytic studies run at millimolar catalyst 
concentrations in 50% aqueous CH 3 CN at pH 7.0 ( K  ≈  1  ×  10 5  M  − 1 ), but drops to 
1  ×  10 3  M  − 1  in water at pH 7.0. In the aim at developing metal catalysts which are soluble 
enough in water to avoid the use of organic cosolvents, the [12]aneN 3 ligating unit seemed 
appropriate, because its high afﬁ nity for zinc(II) in water (Log  K  =  8.4 at 25  ° C) ensures 
extensive binding of the metal ion to the ligand even at submillimolar concentrations. 32 
Unfortunately, the zinc(II) complexes of ligands  28 – 31  were not soluble enough in water 
for catalytic studies. Furthermore, catalytic studies carried out in 50% aqueous CH 3 CN 
(Table  8.3 ) revealed a disappointing lack of synergism between metal ions, which is at 
variance with the results obtained with the corresponding BAMP complexes.  25,28 The 
moral of this story is that even promising arrangements of catalytically effective ligated

 Figure 8.5   HPNP transesteriﬁ cation catalyzed by  29 − Cu 2 . Proposed mode of substrate 
binding and activation  
between metal centres is signiﬁ cant in the 1,2 - vicinal dinuclear complex  29 – Cu 2 . 32 In 
contrast, the catalytic efﬁ ciency of  30 – Cu 2 is about twice as great as that of  27 – Cu, 
showing that there is no rate acceleration per metal centre. It also appears that the trime-
tallic complex  31 – Cu 3 behaves as a 1,2 - vicinal dinuclear catalyst, whose efﬁ ciency is 
somewhat lowered by the third metal centre. The close adherence to the Michaelis –
 Menten equation (Figure  8.4 ) indicates the intermediacy of a reversibly formed, moder-
ately stable HPNP - catalyst complex ( K  =  1/ K M  =  500  M  − 1 ). A likely mode of binding of 
HPNP to the catalyst involves interaction of the phosphate moiety to the copper(II) ions 
in the 1,2 - vicinal position (Figure  8.5 ), in what amounts to double Lewis - acid activation, 
with the putative involvement of the metal hydroxide as a general base.

Reactivity Control by Calixarenes 
219
 It is well known that species that cleave effectively  p - nitrophenyl phosphates are not 
necessarily good catalysts for the cleavage of unactivated phosphate esters. It was there-
fore quite gratifying to ﬁ nd that  31 – Cu 3 cleaves with high efﬁ ciency eight diribonucle-
oside monophosphates (Equation  8.11 ) out of nine in the tested lot (Table  8.4 ).  32 Catalytic 
rate accelerations are in the order of 10 4  - fold in most cases, to be compared with the 10 3 -
 fold rate accelerations in the cleavage of HPNP (Table  8.3 ). The rate enhancement rises 
to 10 5  - fold in the cleavage of UpU and this was suggested to be caused by the additional 
binding site arising from the copper - assisted deprotonation of the uracyl moiety at the 
5 ′ - hydroxyl terminus. 
 
 
 
 (8.11) 
 The inertness of CpA in the presence of  31 – Cu 3  (Table  8.4 ) is not due to the inherently 
low reactivity of the substrate, nor to its insensitivity to copper(II) catalysis, as shown by 
the ﬁ nding that CpA is cleaved by [12]aneN 3 – Cu and  30 – Cu 2  about 3 times more rapidly 
than UpU.  32   Furthermore, the efﬁ ciency of  31 – Cu 3  in the cleavage of UpU is similar to

that of  29 – Cu 2 , and this reinforces the view that  31 – Cu 3  uses only two vicinal metal 
centres in the catalysis, with the third metal ion acting as a more or less innocent spectator. 
 The phosphodiesterase activity of the copper(II) complexes was further explored in the 
cleavage of oligomeric ribonucleotides.  33   The kinetics was investigated using gel electro-
phoresis to separate and analyze reactant and products having a radioactive phosphate 
label in the 5 ′  - terminal position (Equation  8.12 ). Rate constants for the cleavage of all of 
the scissile bonds of oligoribonucleotides  32 – 37 , obtained either from time - course kinet-
ics (e.g. Figure  8.6 ) or from initial rates, are listed in Table  8.5 , where the fatness of the 
arrows pointing to the scissile bonds gives a rough indication of the relative reactivity. 
There is an undeniable tendency for the catalytic efﬁ ciency to increase with the number 
of metal units, revealing variable extents of cooperation between metal centres of trime-
tallic and bimetallic complexes. In a number of cases the 1,2 - vicinal complex  29 – Cu 2 is 
superior to its distal regioisomer  30 – Cu 2 , in line with what observed in the reactions of 
HPNP and UpU, but in other cases the reverse holds. A similar, not clearly deﬁ ned situ-
ation, holds for the relative efﬁ ciency of trinuclear  vs.  dinuclear complexes, because the 
observed reactivity order strongly depends on oligoribonucleotide identity. In any event, 
whenever the trinuclear complex is the best cleaving agent in the lot, the advantage due 
to the third metal ion hardly exceeds a factor of 2, which indicates that a compelling 
evidence of the operation of trimetallic catalysis is lacking. It is worth noting that the rate 
enhancement of  ca. 5  ×  10 5  - fold relative to background in the cleavage of CpA bound in 
 35  by  31 – Cu 3  is one of the highest values recorded for a synthetic metallonuclease in the 
cleavage of ribonucleotide dimers or higher oligomers.  25,34

  (8.12) 
 In marked contrast to the UpU and UpG selectivity observed in the reaction of oligori-
bonucleoside monophosphates (Table  8.4 ), a remarkable selectivity in the cleavage of the 
CpA bond of oligoribonucleotides  32  and  35  is observed for all metal complexes (Table 
 8.5 ). This is fully conﬁ rmed by the behaviour of heptadecamer  38 , in which all CpA 
bonds are cleaved by  29 – Cu 2  (Table  8.6 ), whereas other bonds do not undergo appreciable 
scission. A closely similar behaviour was experienced in the presence of  30 – Cu 2 . CpA

bonds labelled as   α ,   β  and   γ  are cleaved much more rapidly than bonds labelled as   δ and 
 ε , which suggests that far away CpA bonds are cleaved more slowly than bonds closer 
to the 5 ′ - terminal position. This view is corroborated by the reactivity ratios of 27  :  10  :  1 
calculated from the data in Table  8.5 for the  31 – Cu 3  catalyzed cleavage of the CpA bond 
in  35 ,  32  and  36 , respectively. A mechanism consistent with the above ﬁ ndings is depicted 
in Figure  8.7 . The primary binding interaction between catalyst and substrate involves 
one of the metal centres and the  32 P - radiolabelled 5 ′  - terminal phosphate dianion. One of 
the possible productive complexes ( II ) is depicted as a dinuclear metallomacrocycle 
arising from intramolecular binding of one of the singly charged phosphates to the 
other metal centre. The fact that  K II  is expected to decrease on increasing the ring size is 
well in keeping with the ﬁ nding that scissile bonds close to the 5 ′ - terminus are cleaved 
more easily. 
 8.4  Concluding Remarks 
 In this chapter we have shown that calixarenes have undergone a limited, but highly 
signiﬁ cant amount of research on their ability to include into their cavities reactant guests 
or part - structures of reactants, thereby exerting a strong reactivity control of hosted 
species in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions.

Reactivity Control by Calixarenes 
223
 The versatility of calixarenes as platforms on which to build mono -  and multitopic 
ligands has been known for long. In the second part of the chapter we have focussed on 
the dynamic preorganization of the calix[4]arene platform, that induces high levels of 
cooperation between two and, possibly, three ligated metal ions in the cleavage of car-
boxylate esters and phosphodiesters, including RNA oligonucleotides. 
 It is felt that calixarenes have not exhausted their potential yet, and that future research 
in the area of reactivity control and catalysis by calixarenes looks promising of exciting 
new results.

Reactions Inside Carcerands

 9.1  Introduction 
 Molecular container molecules are spherical, hollow hosts with inner cavities that are 
large enough to accommodate one or more guest molecules.  1   They were developed by 
Donald J. Cram in the mid 1980s and have been used extensively as molecular reaction 
ﬂ ask in order to study the effect of the conﬁ nement on reactions involving the encapsu-
lated guest. 2 
 In 1985, Cram and co - workers synthesized carcerand  1  by multiply linking cavitand  2 
and  3 (Figure  9.1 ). 3   The name carcerand is derived from the Latin word  carcer , which 
means  ‘ prison ’ . During the shell - closure,  1  trapped almost every component present in 
the reaction ﬂ ask. In carcerands, the incarcerated guest cannot leave the container even 
at high temperature. Complexes with permanently imprisoned guests are termed carce-
plexes. In contrast, hemicarcerands form stable hemicarceplexes at ambient temperature, 
but incarcerate and release guests at elevated temperature, whereby the guest passes 
through one of the size - restricted equatorial openings in the host shell (Figure  9.2 ). 
 Hemicarceplexes are stabilized by intrinsic and constrictive binding energy.  4 The latter, 
a physical barrier, is the activation free energy required for a guest to enter the inner 
cavity and typically amounts to 25 – 30  kcal  mol  − 1 . 4b   In carceplexes, this barrier is so high 
that guest escape is impossible without host destruction. Isolated from the bulk phase, the

guest can freely rotate inside its molecular prison. Cram coined the name  ‘ inner phase ’ 
for the interior of a container compound since the properties of an incarcerated guest 
molecule are different from those in the bulk phase.   
 A large variety of hemicarcerands have been synthesized by connecting two cavitands 
with four appropriate linkers (Figure  9.3 ).  4b,5 Among those, perhaps, the most versatile 
container molecule with respect to binding properties is hemicarcerand  4 , which forms 
stable hemicarceplexes with guests ranging in size from benzene to naphthalene. Owing 
to its excellent binding properties and the ease of preparing hemicarceplexes,  4  has been 
the host of choice for applications as molecular reaction ﬂ ask to study reactions of encap-
sulated guests.  
 The synthesis of hemicarcerands and carceplexes is a templated reaction and the proper 
choice of template molecule, which complements the shape and size of the inner cavity

of the desired hemicarcerand, is vitally important. 6 – 7   For carceplex  5  Guest, yields 
ranged from zero to 89% and template efﬁ ciency correlates nicely with the size and 
shape complementarity of inner cavity and guest.  8   Yields are highest, when the cavitands 
and template can be preassembled in a trimeric hydrogen - bonded complex  6 . 8b – c,9 The 
H - bonding complex  6  is unimportant for the formation of hemicarceplexes  4  Guest 
and of other larger hemicarceplexes.  10   For the larger host  4 , linking the two cavitands 
with the ﬁ rst bridge disrupts the H - bonds of  6  allowing for subsequent intermolecular 
and intramolecular reactions. The template does not affect the course of the reaction 
until after the second linker is introduced and has determined the fate of the product. 
In  N  - methylpyrrolidinone as solvent, closing the host shell with the fourth bridge is 
rate determining and requires heating.  5e,f   At room temperature, diol  7  accumulates and 
becomes available. Diol  7  provides an easy entry to unsymmetrical hemicarcerands with 
three unique and one different linker (e.g.  8 – 13 in Figure  9.3 ). 5e.f,11 Furthermore, using 
the so - called  ‘ seal - in ’  procedure, hemicarceplexes  4  Guest or  8 – 13  Guest can be syn-
thesized by reacting  7  with a linker unit in the presence of the guest in the solvent 
hexamethylphosphoramide, which is too large to serve as template.  5e,f The seal - in pro-
cedure allows synthesis of hemicarceplexes with guests that are thermally too unstable 
to be  ‘ heated ’ into empty  4 or  8 – 13 . 12 
 The novelty of hemicarcerand structures has lured molecular container chemists to 
study properties and reactivity of incarcerated guests. Interesting questions that seek 
answers are: Could one conduct reactions inside hemicarcerands and how would they 
differ from their bulk phase counterparts? How do small reactants such as protons, elec-
trons or photons pass through the host skeleton in order to reach the incarcerated guest? 
Can we even generate and protect highly reactive molecules inside the inner phase and 
prevent their self - destruction via dimerization or the reaction with bulk phase reactants 
that are too large to pass through the protective host skin? Is catalysis possible in such 
novel reaction chambers? In the following, I will summarize recent efforts in exploring 
inner phase chemistry and in stabilizing reactive intermediates by incarceration. 
 9.2  Types of Inner Phase Reactions 
 Conceptually, one can divide inner phase reactions into four groups (Figure  9.5 ): 
 (1)  Intermolecular inner phase reactions 
 (2)  Intramolecular inner phase reactions 
 (3)  Mother molecule – daughter molecule reactions 
 (4)  Innermolecular inner phase reactions. 
 In intermolecular inner phase reactions, the incarcerated guest reacts with a bulk phase 
reactant. This may require full or partial passage of the bulk phase reactant through one 
of the openings in the host shell. In most cases, it is difﬁ cult to discriminate between both 
models. Many different intermolecular inner phase reactions have been carried out with 
sometimes very surprising outcomes and are summarized in section  9.4 . 
 Light or heat triggers intramolecular inner phase reactions and causes rearrangement 
of the incarcerated guest or fragmentation. Such reactions have lead to the generation of 
incarcerated reactive intermediates and are discussed in sections  9.5  – 6 .

Reactions Inside Carcerands

 Two further new inner phase reaction types have been introduced recently. In Okazaki ’ s 
mother molecule – daughter molecule - reactions, an external stimulus leads to the release 
of a guest (daughter), which was covalently linked to the inner surface of the surrounding 
container (mother) to form a new mother molecule – daughter molecule complex. 13 The 
opposite are innermolecular reactions.  14   The incarcerated guest reacts with the inner 
surface of the surrounding molecular container leading to a covalent adduct. The latter 
two reaction types are particularly interesting. The mother molecule – daughter molecule 
complex formation allows the generation of an encapsulated reactive intermediate or of 
an endohedral - ﬁ xed reactive functionality, which both are protected by the surrounding 
capsule shell. Innermolecular reactions are interesting since these reactions take part at 
the concave inner surface of one reactant (the host), which is rather uncommon.  
 9.3  Probing the Properties of the Inner Phase 
 9.3.1  Amide C − N Bond Rotation and Ring - Flip of Cyclohexanes 
 The precise mix of free and occupied space inside the reactant ﬁ lled container, 15 the shape 
of the inner phase, the rigidity of the container and the electronic nature of its inner surface 
may all or in part contribute to the reaction dynamics and selectivity of an inner phase 
reaction. Reversible conformational changes of guest molecules are easily tractable spec-
troscopically and ideal to study the effect of conﬁ nement on transition states. Cram and 
co - workers studied the  cis - trans isomerization of (CH 3 ) 2 NCHO and (CH 3 ) 2 NCOCH 3 
inside  5 . 5a For (CH 3 ) 2 NCHO, the C − N rotational barrier decreased in the order liquid 
phase  >  inner phase  >    vacuum and was  ∼ 1  kcal  mol  − 1  lower inside  5  than in nitrobenzene. 
For (CH 3 ) 2 NCOCH 3 , the order was inner phase    >  liquid phase  >    vacuum and the barrier

 ∼ 2  kcal  mol  − 1  higher inside  5  than in solution. Cram explained these trends with the dif-
ferent ratio of free and occupied space in the inner phase. In CPK models, (CH 3 ) 2 NCHO 
is loosely held inside the container, whereas (CH 3 ) 2 NCOCH 3 is strongly compressed 
against the host walls in the ground state and even more so in the transition state for bond 
rotation. Thus, the rigid container resists being deformed more than the solvent cage 
resists being moved to accommodate the transition state. Depending on the mix of free 
and occupied space, the inner phase may be more like vacuum, liquid or even solid. 
Likewise ring inversion of 1,4 - thioxane and 1,4 - dioxane has a 1.8  kcal  mol  − 1 and 
1.6  kcal  mol  − 1  higher barrier inside  5  than in the liquid phase (Figure  9.6 ).  16 The origin 
for the increased barriers is not fully clear and may result from ground state effects, such 
as stabilizing host - guest contacts that are lost in the transition state, or steric constraints 
in the transition state. Nevertheless, one can conclude that host rigidity translates into 
high sensitivity towards small structural perturbations of the guest. 
 9.3.2  Spectroscopic Probes 
 Molecules that change their photophysical characteristics in response to changes in the 
environment are well suited to probe the electronic and spatial properties of conﬁ ned 
spaces. 17 Pina  et al . measured large bathochromic shifts for absorption, ﬂ uorescence and 
phosphorescence maxima upon incarcerating biacetyl inside  14 (Figures  9.3 and  9.7 ). 18 
These shifts are far outside the range of values of free biacetyl in any solvent. Nau 
interpreted these red - shifts with an unusually high polarizability inside  14 . 19 Absorption 
maxima and inverse oscillator strength correlated linearly with solvent polarizability. 
From these solvatochromic shifts, Nau estimated the polarizability of the inner phase, 
which is substantially higher than that of the highly polarizable diodomethane. Compared 
to the cavity of cyclodextrins or cucurbit[7]urils, which have polarizabilities that are 
closer to the other extreme,  19   the inner phase constitutes an environment of unusually high 
polarizability, which has consequences for the dynamics of inner phase reactions as will 
be discussed later. 
 Nau ’ s interpretation was later challenged by Romanova  et al . who studied the ﬂ uores-
cence and phosphorescence properties of biacetyl inside three hemicarcerands with dif-
ferent cavity sizes.  20   Emission maxima experienced bathochromic shifts and increased in

the order  4  <  14  <  15 . However, the singlet - triplet excited state energy gap   ∆ S 1 – T 1 
remained nearly constant for all three hemicarceplexes. Since the S 1  →  S 0 transition 
moment is orders of magnitude larger than that of the forbidden T 1  →  S 0  transition, a 
coupling between the transition dipole and polarizability dipole cannot be the origin for 
the emission shifts. Romanova  et al . explained these shifts with smaller amounts of free 
space inside the inner cavity as compared to liquids and postulated a higher  ‘ effective 
local pressure ’  inside hemicarcerands. With decreasing cavity size biacetyl may twist out 
of planarity, which would explain the observed trend. 
 9.4  Through - Shell Reactions 
 9.4.1  Proton Transfer Reactions 
 The investigation of proton transfer between incarcerated bases and bulk phase acids 
provides insight into the effect of incarceration on the guest ’ s acidity or basicity. It is 
expected that the hydrophobicity of the inner phase will alter the p K a  of the incarcerated 
guest, which is reminiscent to many enzyme - catalyzed reactions.  21 Cram and co - workers 
studied proton transfers between a strong bulk phase acid and incarcerated amines 
 15  pyridine,  15  (CH 3 CH 2 ) 2 NH and  15  CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 NH 2 . 4a   Despite a large enough 
opening in the shell of  15 , attempts to protonate incarcerated pyridine with CF 3 COOD in 
CDCl 3  failed. Cram suggested that the reduced basicity is a result of ineffective solvation 
of the pyridinium ion by the rigid host, the inability to form a contact ion pair in the inner 
phase and the larger size of the pyridinium ion compared to pyridine. Inaccessibility of 
the unshared electron pair of incarcerated pyridine would also be an explanation, but 
seems very unlikely (Figure  9.8 A). 
 For  15  (CH 3 CH 2 ) 2 NH, instantaneous decomplexation of  15  (CH 3 CH 2 ) 2 ND 2 + accom-
panied through - shell proton transfer. The ability to protonate  15  (CH 3 CH 2 ) 2 NH with 
CF 3 COOD in CDCl 3  results from the location of the nitrogen of (CH 3 CH 2 ) 2 NH in the 
equatorial region close to the portals (Figure  9.8 B). After protonation, the counter ion

pulled the guest out of the inner phase. Addition of excess CF 3 COOD to  15  CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 NH 2 
lead to a 2  :  1 mixture of  15  CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 ND 3 + and  15  CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 ND 2 , which remained 
constant over time although slow decomplexation took place. Complete protonation of 
 15  CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 NH 2  required 100 eq. of CF 3 COOD. Excess CD 3 COOD only H/D 
exchanged the amine protons. These results show that the acidity of incarcerated 
CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 NH 2  is comparable to that of CF 3 COOH in CDCl 3 . Furthermore, the strong 
upﬁ eld - shifted amine protons of  15  CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 NH 2  imply guest alignment along the 
polar axis of  15 . In this orientation, through - shell protonation most likely occurs through 
the holes in the polar caps of  15 (Figure  9.8 C). 
 9.4.2  Electron Transfer Reactions 
 Electron transfer (ET) plays an important role in many organic reactions.  22 Although ET 
processes are most efﬁ cient in contact donor acceptor complexes, electron tunneling over 
long distance is possible.  23   Thus, ET reactions are well suited to be studied between an 
incarcerated guest and a bulk phase reducing or oxidizing agent. An oxidation - reduction 
cycle for hydroquinones  16 – 19  could be carried out in the interior of  4 (Figure  9.9 ). 24 
Oxidation with Ce(NH 4 ) 2 (NO 2 ) 6 – silica gel − CDCl 3 or Tl(O 2 CCF 3 ) 3 − CCl 4  led to the parent 
incarcerated quinones  20 – 23 in essentially quantitative yields. 
 In the absence of light, the incarcerated quinones were stable below 100    ° C, despite 
their usual instability in solution. Reduction back to the hydroquinones was possible 
with SmI 2 /MeOH. The same reagent reduced nitrobenzene  24  to  N - hydroxyl - aniline 
 25 . Surprisingly, aniline, which is the product in the liquid phase, is not formed. The latter 
result, the high yields, and the instability of free  o  - quinones, suggests that all reduction/
oxidation took place inside  4 , rather than by a dissociation  –  bulk phase reaction  – 
association mechanism. It also demonstrates that electrons are transferred readily through 
the host shell in and out of the inner phase. The exact mechanism of the ET and the role of 
the intervening medium (the host) are not clear yet. To get more insight, Kaifer compared 
the electrochemical behavior of free and incarcerated ferrocene inside  26 (Figures  9.3 and 
 9.9 ). 25   In the inner phase, ET was strongly hindered kinetically and thermodynamically. 
A more positive half - way potential for the oxidation, due to the hydrophobicity of the 
inner phase, as well as 10 - fold rate retardation was measured. To support the observation

of an inner phase oxidation/reduction cycle, Kaifer isolated oxidized ferrocene hemicarce-
plex  26  ferrocene + . The NMR spectrum showed large spectral shifts and line - broadening 
compared to that of  26  ferrocene, which is consistent with the formation of paramagnetic 
ferrocene + . The blue color of ferrocene +  and its NMR spectrum persisted at room tempera-
ture for days until  26  ferrocene +  slowly reverted back to  26  ferrocene, revealing that 
guest dissociation/association can be excluded within the time frame of the electrochemi-
cal experiments. Kaifer suggested that the slower ET between the incarcerated ferrocene 
and the electrode surface could result partially from the higher mass of  26  ferrocene 
compared to ferrocene and also from a reduction of the electronic coupling between the 
ferrocene center and the electrode which is affected by the increase in distance from 3.5  Å 
to about 9  Å . Whether the hemicarcerand ’ s aromatic structure mediates the electron 
coupling is not clear. 
 9.4.3  Nucleophilic Substitutions and Isotopic Exchanges 
 The alkylation studies of Kurdistani  et al . provide much insight into the relationship 
between reactivity and guest orientation and bulk phase reagent size.  5e Different phenols 
were alkylated in the inner phase of  4 . Two factors determined the observed reactivity: 
(a) portal size and (b) preferred guest orientation relative to the equatorial - located portals. 
Alkylation with NaH/MeI in THF of 4 - HOC 6 H 4 CH 3 ( p - cresol) or 4 - HOC 6 H 4 OH ( p -
 hydroquinone) was impossible. Under the same conditions, 2 - HOC 6 H 4 CH 3 ( o - cresol), 
3 - HOC 6 H 4 CH 3 ( m - cresol), and 3 - HOC 6 H 4 OH (resorcinol) were quantitatively methylated. 
2 - HOC 6 H 4 OH (catechol) gave a mixture of mono -  and dimethylated carceplexes. An 
examination of typical crystal structures of hemicarceplexes with 1,4 - disubstituted 
benzene guest suggests that the OH - group of 4 - HOC 6 H 4 CH 3  is located in a protected polar 
cap of the host.  5b In  ortho - or  meta  - disubstituted benzenes, one substituent resides inside 
a shielded polar cap, whereas the second substituent is located near a portal. This suggests 
that these reactions must occur in the entryways through a linear transition state, which 
is partially  ‘ solvated ’  by the alkoxy - units that align the host ’ s portals (Figure  9.10 ). Since 
this  ‘ pseudo solvent cage ’  has limited ﬂ exibility, alkylation with larger alkylating agents 
failed. 
 Likewise in D 2 O - saturated CDCl 3 , no D - for - H exchange of OH groups was possible 
when guests were 4 - HOC 6 H 4 CH 3 , 2 - HOC 6 H 4 OH or 4 - HOC 6 H 4 OH. 5e   In the presence of 
diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec - 7 - ene, 4 - HOC 6 H 4 OH exchanged its hydroxyl - protons, but not

the conformationally more ﬁ xed 4 - HOC 6 H 4 CH 3 . In THF - NaH at 25  ° C followed by D 2 O -
 quench, the hydroxyl - protons of 2 - HOC 6 H 4 OH, which are more exposed to the equatorial -
 located portals, exchange, but not the protected hydroxyl - protons of 4 - HOC 6 H 4 OH and 
4 - HOC 6 H 4 CH 3 . 
 Such steric interactions in the transition state, that serve as selectivity criteria in these 
inner phase reactions, also contribute to the highly structural recognition in enzyme -
 catalyzed reactions. The understanding of these interactions provides valuable guidelines 
for the rational design of novel highly selective catalysts in the future.  
 9.4.4  Nucleophilic Additions 
 Inner phase guest orientation and mobility also control reactivity in through - shell borane 
and methyllithium additions to benzaldehyde  27 , benzocyclobutenone  28  and benzocy-
clobutadione  29  inside hemicarcerand  4 . 26 BH 3  - THF reduced all three incarcerated guests 
to the corresponding alcohols  30 – 32 (Figure  9.11 A – C). Guest reactivity differed from 
that in the liquid phase and increased in the order  29  ≈  28  >  27 . Furthermore, incarcerated 
 29  added only one equivalent of BH 3 - THF. Reduction of the second carbonyl group 
required aqueous work - up followed by addition of BH 3 - THF to  4  33 . Hydrolysis of 
 4  33 gave incarcerated  cis - benzocyclobutenediol  34 . X - ray structures helped to rational-
ize these observations (Figure  9.11 D – E). 
 In  4  27  and  4  28 , the guest ’ s carbonyl groups are located inside a host ’ s cavitand 
and reduction requires reorientation of the guest. The additional conformational energy 
adds to the activation energy and is higher for  27  as compared to  28 . In  4  29 , one carbo-
nyl is shielded. The other is perfectly positioned for through - shell reaction inside an 
entryway. After addition to the exposed C = O, coordination of the boron of  35  to a host ’ s 
ether oxygen hinders guest rotation and prevents exposure of the second C = O until  35 is 
hydrolyzed. 
 Guest orientations also explain outcomes of CH 3 Li additions to incarcerated  27 – 29 
(Figure  9.12 ). Again, guest reactivity decreased in the order  29  >>  28  >  27 .  29 added 
one equivalent of CH 3 Li already at  − 78  ° C to yield  36  and Moore rearrangement product 
 37 . 27   No double - addition took place. Hemicarceplex  4  28  required room temperature 
for a complete reaction. Under the same conditions,  4  27  reacted sluggishly and 
incompletely. 
 Very interesting are the formation of host cleavage products  39  and  7  in these reactions, 
which resulted from innermolecular reactions of the incarcerated lithium alcoholates. In 
the CH 3 Li addition to  4  28 , lithium alcoholate  40  partially underwent an innermolecular 
nucleophilic displacement at one of the host ’ s acetals yielding hemicarcerand  39 and 
 39  41 (Figures  9.12 – 9.13 ). On the other hand, at 0  ° C incarcerated lithium alcoholates 
 43  and/or  44  cleaved one of the O − (CH 2 ) 4 − O linker of  4  via   β - elimination (Figure  9.13 B). 
Bulk phase lithium alcoholates are not basic enough to induce this reaction. The incarcer-
ated counterparts must be several orders of magnitude more reactive. Three factors con-
tribute to this rate - acceleration. (1) The absence of aggregation of R ′ OLi in the inner 
phase. 28   (2) The poor ability of  4  to  ‘ solvate ’ R ′ OLi, which increases its basicity.  4a (3) 
Lithium coordination to an oxygen lone pair of the cleaved C − O bond positions the 
alkoxide O in close proximity to the   β  - H of the bridge and provides charge compensation 
during the concerted  syn - elimination (Figure  9.13 B). 29   These examples and those dis-
cussed in the previous section show that through - shell and inner phase chemistry clearly

differs from  ‘ conventional ’  chemistry in the bulk phase with respect to reactivity and 
selectivity. Inner phase and through - shell reactions show the following characteristic 
features: 
  (1)     Guest functional groups that reside inside a host ’ s polar cap are less reactive than 
those exposed to an equatorial portal, which have the potential for high through - shell 
reactivity. 
 (2)  The reactivity of bulk phase reactants is largely inﬂ uenced by their size and shape 
relative to that of the host ’ s equatorial portals.

  (3)     If functional groups are protected in the guest ’ s most favorable orientation, reactivity 
depends on the inner phase rotational mobility of the guest. 
  (4)     The basicity and nucleophilicity of incarcerated lithium alcoholates exceeds those of 
bulk phase alcoholates by several orders of magnitude resulting in efﬁ cient inner -
 molecular elimination or nucleophilic transacetalisation and formation of hemi-
carcerands with one extended portal. In these innermolecular reactions, small structural 
changes of the guest have a sound effect on the reaction mode.        
 9.5  Intramolecular Thermal Reactions 
 In the previous section we have seen that the nucleophilicity and basicity of incarcerated 
lithium alcoholates strongly exceeds those of bulk phase alcoholates mainly as a result 
of the lack of aggregation and poor solvation by the host.  26   As a consequence, innermo-
lecular reaction involving lithium alcoholates are strongly accelerated. Several extrusion 
reactions have been studied inside container molecules and have highlighted additional 
ways how encapsulation inside a hemicarcerand may accelerate or decelerate inner phase 
reactions.

and/formation takes place in close proximity of the host ’ s aryl units. 30,31 The thermo-
lysis of diazirines is a common method to produce carbenes and its mechanism has 
been studied in detail (Figure  9.14 A).  32   Compared to the bulk phase, inner phase 
fragmentation of  48  is 15 - fold accelerated, that of  49  slightly faster (1.2 fold) and 
that of  50 2.4 - fold slower. 30   Furthermore, all inner phase transition states are stabilized 
enthalpically by 2 – 3  kcal  mol  − 1 , which, in the case of  49  and  50 , is partially or fully 
compensated by unfavorable entropic contributions to   ∆ G ‡ . The unfavorable   ∆ T ∆ S ‡ 
term likely results from loss of vibrational degrees of freedom as the guest expands 
upon reaching the transition state leading to a tighter hemicarceplex. The favorable 
enthalpic stabilization is interesting and was explained with the high polarizability of 
the inner phase.  19,31 The stretched C − N bonds of the transition state are more polariz-
able than those of the ground state. Thus, the transition state will be stronger stabilized

through dispersion interactions,  33   especially since bond breaking takes place in close 
proximity of the highly polarizable aryl units of a cavitand (Figure  9.14 B – C). 
 In an extended study, Sanchez Carrera  et al . explored the inﬂ uence of hemicarcerand 
shape on the thermolysis of phenyldiazirines.  31   All inner phase transition states were 
slightly accelerated. Rate constants increase in the order:  9  49  >  12  49  >  10  49  >  
 4  49  >  13  49  and vary overall by a factor of 3.2. Again, inner phase transition states 
where stabilized enthalpically by about 2  kcal  mol  − 1  and moderately destabilized entropi-
cally. Furthermore, faster rates were observed for hemicarceplexes whose fourth shorter 
bridge induces a slight kink in the host structure. This was interpreted with an induced 
ﬁ t model and a better ability of the latter hemicarcerands to accommodate the slightly 
bend transition state.  
 9.5.2  Fragmentation of 3 - Sulfolene 
 A very interesting thermal pericyclic reaction inside the asymmetric carcerand  51 was 
recently reported by Reinhoudt and co - workers. 34 They studied the extrusion of SO 2 and 
butadiene from incarcerated 3 - sulfolene by mass spectrometry (Figure  9.15 ).  34b 
 The extrusion of SO 2  and butadiene from free 3 - sulfolene readily takes place at 100 –
 130  ° C. Substantially higher temperatures were required for carceplex  51  3 - sulfolene. 
SO 2  was only detected above 170 – 180  ° C, and butadiene at 215    ° C. Up to 180    ° C only 
the intact carceplex was observed. Above 180    ° C, also empty  51  but neither a SO 2 car-
ceplex, nor a butadiene carceplex was detected. Since this host is stable at such high 
temperatures, guest escape due to the thermal destruction of  51  can be excluded. Hence, 
the detected SO 2  and butadiene must result from  51  3 - sulfolene and must escape the

inner phase through one of the larger side portals. Reinhoudt explained the unusually 
high thermal stability of incarcerated 3 - sulfolene with a fast recombination in the inner 
phase (Figure  9.15 ). Below 180  ° C, a thermal equilibrium between 3 - sulfolene, SO 2 and 
butadiene is established, which is pulled towards the extrusion products via their escape 
from the inner phase above 180    ° C. This shows impressively how the conﬁ nement 
changes the rates of bimolecular reactions by providing a very high local concentration 
of both reactants. 35 
 9.6  Inner Phase Photochemistry 
 9.6.1  Inner Phase Stabilization of Reactive Intermediates: Concept 
 The possibility to photolyze incarcerated guest molecules opens up the opportunity to 
generate and protect highly strained and reactive molecules inside carcerands.  2 This 
allows NMR spectroscopic characterization of otherwise ﬂ eeting species, which comple-
ments matrix isolation spectroscopy, ultra - fast spectroscopy or ﬂ ow techniques. The 
concept of reactive intermediate stabilization by incarceration was introduced by Cram, 
Tanner and Thomas with  ‘ the taming of cyclobutadiene ’  and is outlined in Figure  9.16 .  36 
 Photolysis of a suitable, stable photochemical precursor yields the reactive intermediate 
in the inner phase. Once generated, the surrounding host prevents destructive reactions, 
such as dimerization or trapping with bulk phase reactants that are too large to pass 
through an opening in the host shell. Difﬁ cult to prevent are innermolecular reactions 
with the surrounding host, which may take place with incarcerated carbenes, nitrenes, 
radicals and arynes, thus limiting their lifetime. In the following sections, several exam-
ples will be discussed. 
 9.6.2  Cyclobutadiene 
 ‘ The taming of cyclobutadiene ’  inside  15  is the ﬁ rst example of an inner phase stabiliza-
tion of a reactive intermediate and nicely demonstrates the power of this approach (Figure 
 9.17 ). 36 Cyclobutadiene  52  is the prototypical example to verify theory of aromaticity.  37,38

It is severely angle - strained in addition to being antiaromatic.  38,39 Cram and co - workers 
generated  52 inside  15 by irradiating  α - pyrone hemicarceplex  15  53 . 
 Hemicarcerand  15  has a larger, slot - shaped opening that permits passage of  53 at 
 > 120  ° C, but retains the guest at ambient temperature. Irradiation above 300   nm converted 
 15  53  to photopyrone  15  54 , which as a solid, rearranged to  15  55 at 90  ° C. At higher 
temperature,  15  55  reverted quantitatively back to  15  53 . Controlled irradiation of 
 15  53  with unﬁ ltered UV light produced nearly quantitatively cyclobutadiene. Prolonged 
photolysis split encapsulated cyclobutadiene into acetylenes. The latter escaped the inner 
phase and could be precipitated as red cuprous acetylide. In the absence of oxygen, 
cyclobutadiene was stable up to 60    ° C! and was characterized for the ﬁ rst time by  1 H

ing host. The lifetime of incarcerated cyclobutadiene is controlled by the barrier of its 
passage through the larger opening inside  15 . If a solution of  15  52  was heated in a 
sealed tube at high temperatures, the guest escaped the protective shelter and dimerized. 
Also, oxygen, which easily passes through the host shell, trapped the guest as malealde-
hyde  58 , presumably via an intermediate dioxetane  59 . 
 9.6.3  Anti - Bredt Bridgehead Oleﬁ ns 
 The successful inner phase stabilization of cyclobutadiene suggests that this approach 
may allow stabilization of other molecules with highly strained multiple bonds. An inter-
esting class of hydrocarbons with twisted C = C bonds are  anti - Bredt bridgehead oleﬁ ns. 41 
These bicycloalkenes have a  trans  - cycloalkene and are unstable if their oleﬁ nic strain 
(OS) is  OS  ≥  21  kcal  mol  − 1 . 42 Bicyclo[2.2.2]oct - 1 - ene  60 and (Z) - bicyclo[3.2.1]oct - 1 - ene 
 61 have  OS  =  46.4 and 21.9  kcal  mol  − 1 , 42b respectively and are ﬂ eeting in solution, in part 
due to their high tendency to dimerize or rearrange,  43,44   but were recently room tempera-
ture stabilized inside hemicarcerand  4 . 45   For the inner phase synthesis of  60  and  61 , Jones ’ 
carbene route was chosen (Figure  9.18 ). Contrary to pyrolysis of  64 , 43   inner phase pho-
tolysis of diazirine  66 gave a complex product mixture composed of hemicarceplexes 
 4  60 ,  4  61 , and  4  67  and of small amounts of carbene - hemicarcerand insertion prod-
ucts. Mechanistic studies suggest, that photochemically excited  66 * directly rearranges 
to  60  and  61  without participation of carbene  63 (Figure  9.19 ). 46   Both incarcerated  anti -
 Bredt oleﬁ ns are stable at room temperature in the absence of oxygen. In aerated solution, 
they add O 2  to yield ketoaldehydes  68  and  69 . Oxidation of  4  60  is rapid at room tem-
perature, but requires days at 60    ° C in the case of  61 , which reﬂ ects their different OS. 
Trapping studies also suggested formation of small amounts of the highly strained  62 in 
the photolysis of  4  66 .  62  escaped spectroscopic detection due to its fast isomerization 
to  61 , but could be trapped with O 2 , if photolysis was carried out in aerated solution. 
 A thermal  retro - Diels – Alder reaction of  60 , which in Jones ’  seminal pyrolysis studies 
had served as indirect proof for formation of  60 , 43   could also be induced inside  4 . At 
62  ° C,  60  slowly rearranged to triene  65 , which escaped the inner phase and was identiﬁ ed 
in the bulk by its characteristic  1 H NMR spectrum. 
 9.6.4  o - Benzyne 
 The inner phase stabilization of  o - benzyne  70  inside hemicarcerand  4  uncovered some of 
the limits of the inner phase approach.  14,47   Since its discovery,  48 – 49  o - benzyne has received

much attention by the scientiﬁ c community as intermediate in organic synthesis  50 and due 
to its interesting structural and electronic properties.  51,52   Benzyne has been investigated 
in cryogenic matrices by UV/Vis - , 53 FT - IR - , 54,55   and very recently solid state NMR spec-
troscopy. 56 Chapman ﬁ rst matrix - isolated  o - benzyne by photolyzing benzocyclobutene-
dione  29 at 8  K (Figure  9.20 ). 54   The same route led to the successful inner phase synthesis 
of  o - benzyne. 47 
 Photolysis of hemicarceplex  4  29  yielded hemicarceplex  4  72 . Benzocyclopropenone 
 72  had previously been studied in solution below  − 78  ° C, where it rapidly hydrolyzed in 
the presence of moisture.  57   However, protected inside the hemicarcerand, it was stable at 
room temperature in water - saturated CDCl 3 . The proton chemical shifts of incarcerated 
 72  suggest co - alignment of its C2 axis with the C4 axis of  4  (Figure  9.21 ) such that the 
reactive C = O resides in the shielded region of the inner phase, which explains the high 
stability of the incarcerated guest.

 Further photolysis of  4  72 gave  4  70 . Due to the high   π - bond strain of 50  kcal  mol  − 1 , 58 
 o  - benzyne underwent an innermolecular Diels – Alder reaction with the surrounding  4 that 
was fast above  − 75  ° C (Figure  9.21 ). 14   This reaction is very selective and  70  adds exclu-
sively across the 1,4 - position of an aryl unit of  4 . The MM3 *  minimum energy conformer 
of  4  70 shows strong preorganization of the reactive triple bond for the observed 
Diels – Alder reaction with distances of 4.53  Å  and 4.05  Å  between the reacting carbons 
of host and guest.  59   This high preorganization is reﬂ ected in the moderately negative 
activation entropy   ∆ S  ‡  innermolecular (298  K)  =  − 10.7 cal  mol  − 1  K  − 1 . 14   Interestingly, the meas-
ured  ∆ H  ‡  innermolecular  for the innermolecular addition is slightly higher than the calculated 
 ∆ H  ‡  calc  for the addition of  70  to benzene (Figure  9.21 C).  59   Thus, the increased reactivity 
of  4 must be compensated by steric interactions in the Diels – Alder - transition state origi-
nating from a repulsion between H(1) and aryl unit A (Figure  9.21 B). This suggests that 
an incarcerated 3,6 - disubstituted  o  - benzyne may not be able to react with the host and 
may be stable at room temperature. 
 At  − 75  ° C, the Diels – Alder reaction was slow enough to record  1 H - NMR spectra of 
 4  70 . 47   Protons of  70  resonate at   δ  4.99 and   δ  4.31. Under the assumption that they feel 
the same shielding by the surrounding host as the protons of benzene, the chemical shifts 
of  ‘ free ’  o  - benzyne were estimated at   δ  7.0 and   δ  7.6 in excellent agreement to the cal-
culated shifts.  52a   Much less relatively upﬁ eld shifted are the guest  13 C - signals and provide 
more insight into the electronic properties of  o - benzyne. The measured chemical shift 
for the quaternary carbon of  70  at   δ  181.33 is within the experimental error of the 
average of the three chemical shift tensor principle values   δ  193  ±  15 of matrix isolated 
 13 C - enriched  70  at 20   K in argon.  56 The  13 C - NMR spectrum of incarcerated  o - benzyne 
also provided direct  13 C – 13 C - coupling constants. Comparison of the experimental  13 C – 
 13 C - coupling constants with the coupling constants of model compounds suggested a 
cumulenic character of  o - benzyne (Figure  9.22 ), which, however, contradicts most 
recent results of  ab initio calculations. 52a,60   These calculations predict that  o - benzyne is

character. 
 9.6.5  Phenylcarbene Rearrangement 
 The phenylcarbene rearrangement is one of the most important and fascinating carbene 
rearrangements and was studied inside hemicarcerands  4  and  13 . In the gas phase, phe-
nylcarbene (PC)  74 ring - expands to cyclohepta - 1,2,4,6 - tetraene (CHTE)  76 involving 
bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta - 1,3,5 - triene  75  as intermediate (Figure  9.23 ).  61 – 64   CHTE, a bend and 
twisted allene with 40  kcal  mol  − 1  strain energy,  64   is the local minimum on this part of the 
potential energy surface and enantiomerizes via the planar cyclohepta - 1,3,5 - trienylidene 
 77 as transition state. 63,64 
 Ring - expansion can also be triggered photochemically via excitation of triplet phenyl-
carbene  3 74 generated from phenyldiazomethane or phenyldiazirine (Figure  9.24 ). 12,65 – 69 
 However, even at 77   K, photolysis of  4  49  produced only insertion products  78 
(85% yield) and  79  (4.5%). Both formed via insertion of transient  74  into an inward 
pointing acetal C − H and linker   α - C − H bonds of  4 , respectively. The magnitude 
and temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effects of the acetal insertion, 
suggested considerable tunnelling contributions.  70   After partial deuteration of  4 , the 
kinetic isotope effect of  k H / k D  =  9.8 inside  80  slowed innermolecular insertions and 
sufﬁ ciently increased the lifetime of  3 74 , such that photochemical rearrangement to 
CHTE was possible in 17% yield and 30% yield at 77   K and 15.5   K, respectively. In 
the related inner phase  p - tolylcarbene rearrangements, the yields of 5 - methylcyclohepta -
 1,2,4.6 - tetraene were even higher. Photolysis of  4  50  and perdeuterated  81  50 at 
77  K afforded  4  82  and  81  82  in 41% and 67% yield, respectively. The higher yields 
likely have an extrinsic origin (conﬁ nement). Any carbene - host reaction, be it arylcy-
clopropanation, acetal C − H insertion or linker C − H or C − O insertion, requires tilting 
of the carbene out of its preferred orientation, in which the long axis of the carbene is 
aligned with the polar axis of the host. The greater steric demand of the methyl group

raises the barrier for  83  more than that for  74  (Figure  9.25 ). For example, the barrier 
for guest tumbling around an equatorial C2 axis of the host sharply increases in the 
order benzene  <<  toluene  <<  para - xylene. 5b,10,71 
 Both incarcerated allenes  76  and  82 , persisted for months at room temperature in the 
absence of oxygen and could be characterized by  1 H NMR spectroscopically. An inves-
tigation of their inner phase chemistry showed several interesting phenomena. Exposing 
hemicarceplex  80  CHTE to HCl gas produced instantaneously hemicarceplex 
 80  C 7 H 7 Cl. Subsequent addition of small amounts of CH 3 OH to the bulk phase, trapped 
incarcerated C 7 H 7 Cl ( 84 ) and gave quantitatively C 7 H 7 OCH 3 ( 85 ) (Figure  9.24 ). Addition 
of CH 3 OH to  80  CHTE resulted in no reaction even at elevated temperatures. This seems 
at ﬁ rst surprising since free CHTE yields C 7 H 7 OR instantaneously, if generated in the 
presence of an alcohol ROH.  72   Labeling studies support a mechanism, in which protona-
tion of cycloheptatrienylidene ( 77 ) yields an intermediate tropylium ion (  C H

inner phase,  77 lies more than 20  kcal  mol  − 1 above ground state CHTE, which explains

the inertness of  76  inside  4 . 12   However, in a polar protic solvent, the larger dipole moment 
of  77  and stabilizing carbene  … H − OR hydrogen bonds bring  77  closer in energy to 
CHTE (Figure  9.26 ). 12 
 Also interesting is the autoxidation of incarcerated CHTE in aerated solution. Under 
these conditions, oxygen diffuses into the hemicarcerand and adds to the central allene C 
to produce a spirocyclic dioxirane  86 . The latter  86  rapidly decarboxylates to benzene at 
room temperature. 
 The constrictively stabilized CHTE and MeCHTE allowed the measurement of several 
barriers of phenyl -  and tolylcarbene rearrangements, which up to then were only available 
from high level calculations and allow comparison between experiment and theory.  63,64,73,74

for the enantiomerization barrier, which agrees with all current calculations.  63,64 For the 
corresponding MeCHTE hemicarceplexes, exchange rate constants could be extracted 
from line shape analysis of high temperature NMR spectra.  68   Furthermore, since photoly-
sis of  13  50  produced  13  (+) - MeCHTE and  13  ( − ) - MeCHTE in a ratio  =  1  :  1.15 
(de   =   7%), which substantially differed from the thermodynamic ratio   =   1   :   1.8 at room 
temperature, exchange rate constants could also be measured just below ambient 
temperature. The enantiomerization free energy of the minor and major enantiomer 
 ∆ G  ‡  (minor)  =  20.3  kcal  mol  − 1  and   ∆ G  ‡  (minor)  =  20.6  kcal  mol  − 1  agreed with estimates 
from DFT calculations (  ∆ G  ‡   =  20.0  kcal  mol  − 1 ; B3LYP/6 - 311G * * ). 
 At elevated temperature, the lifetime of incarcerated MeCHTE strongly decreased due 
to ring - contraction resulting in  p - and  m - tolylcarbene (TC) formation (Figure  9.27 ). The 
latter react instantaneously with the surrounding hemicarcerand. A careful analysis of 
rates and products of these ring - contractions gave activation parameters for the MeCHTE 
to  m  -  and MeCHTE to  p  - TC rearrangements. Again, both activation free energies agreed 
very well with those calculated at the B3LYP/6 - 311G *  *  level of theory.  73 Also, the inner 
phase and computed activation enthalpy and entropy for the MeCHTE to  p - TC matched 
very well. Very interesting, however, is the large enthalpy - entropy compensation in the 
inner phase MeCHTE to  m - TC rearrangement. This enthalpy - entropy compensation was 
interpreted with a hemicarcerand and solvent reorganization as a consequence of a dra-
matic change in the guest shape along the reaction coordinate and is taken as indirect 
evidence for the intermediacy of  87 in this rearrangement (Figure  9.27 ). 
 This example illustrates nicely how kinetic experiments in conﬁ ned space allow 
mapping of potential energy surfaces of important organic chemical processes involving 
highly reactive intermediates, which is difﬁ cult to achieve with other techniques such as 
laser ﬂ ash photolysis, CID or matrix isolation.

 9.6.6  Carbenes 
 In the previous chapter, we have seen that incarcerated phenylcarbene rapidly inserts into 
C − H bonds of hemicarcerands even at 77  K. 12,67   Such high reactivity is expected and 
typical for alkyl or arylcarbenes.  75   However, the stability and reactivity of carbenes 
R − C − R ′  depends on the nature of the substituent R and R ′  and can be tailored.  76,77 
Heteroatoms strongly stabilize the singlet state through electron donation and many 
diaminocarbenes are stable and isolable at room temperature.  78   In cases, where intrinsic 
stabilization (e - donation) is not sufﬁ cient, extrinsic effects (incarceration), may render an 
otherwise ﬂ eeting singlet carbene stable under normal conditions. Fluorophenoxycarbene 
 89  is such specie and was recently room temperature stabilized by incarceration (Figure 
 9.28 ). 79,80   Both substituents stabilize  89  by  ∼ 60  kcal  mol  − 1  compared to methylene.  77 Yet, 
 89 , if photochemically generated from diazirine  90 , is ﬂ eeting at room temperature and 
instantaneously dimerizes, reacts with moisture or is trapped in the presence of alkenes.  81 
 Liu  et al . generated incarcerated  89  by irradiation of ﬂ uorophenoxydiazirine hemi-
carceplex  4  90  at low temperature.  79 Incarcerated  89  persisted for weeks at room 
temperature. The  13 C and  19 F NMR spectra of  4  89  provided interesting insight into 
the electronic properties of  9 . The carbenic carbon resonated at   δ  285.7 ppm, which 
compares well to chemical shifts of other persistent heteroatom substituted carbenes.  78 
The strongly downﬁ eld shifted ﬂ uorine, the unusually large  19 F – 13 C coupling constant 
and the considerable upﬁ eld shift of the  ipso  carbon of  89  relative to that of  90 point 
towards strong participation of both O and F atoms in the carbene stabilization through 
push – push effects.

251
 The NMR spectroscopic investigations also showed that incarceration had a strong 
effect on the conformational preference of  89  (Figure  9.29 ). Contrary to gas phase  ab 
initio  calculations, which predict  trans - 89  as the lower energy conformation, the confor-
mational equilibrium is reversed in the inner phase. Thus, conﬁ nement favors the coiled 
and more compact  cis  -  over the extended  trans  conformation, which is consistent with 
the observations of coiled linear alkane conformations in self - assembled molecular 
capsules. 82 
 In the presence of trace amounts of acid, incarcerated  89  slowly reacted with water in 
the bulk phase to yield phenylformate hemicarceplex  4  91  and phenyl diﬂ uoromethyl 
ether hemicarceplex  4  92  (Figure  9.29 ). The requirement of acid catalysis in the inner 
phase water trapping reaction is surprising since catalysis is not required for free  89 . This 
suggests that the water - trapping of  89  is initiated by protonation and that water is not 
acidic enough in the inner phase contrary to the bulk phase. The hydrophobicity of the 
inner phase and lack of solvation of the hypothetical ion pair [ 89 H] + [OH]  −  are likely 
reasons for the absence of this acid base reaction similar to the examples discussed in 
section  9.4.1 .This shows that, incarceration not only prevents dimerization of  89 , but also 
slows trapping reactions with water by many orders of magnitude. 
 9.6.7  Phenylnitrene 
 Very recently, phenylnitrene (PN) and its intramolecular rearrangement have been inves-
tigated inside hemicarcerand  4 . 83   PN is an important reactive intermediate for organic 
synthesis and photoafﬁ nity labeling of biomacromolecules. 84 It is isoelectronic with 
phenylcarbene (PC) and undergoes very similar intramolecular chemistry.  61c,85,86 Above 
 − 100  ° C,  1 PN rapidly ring - expands to the highly strained cyclic ketenimine  95 , which can 
be trapped with amines or other nucleophiles. Below  − 100  ° C,  1 PN intersystem crosses 
to triplet  3 PN (Figure  9.30 ). 
 Though at ﬁ rst glance PN and PC show great similarity in their chemistry, their reactiv-

lecular reactivity of  1 PC. 73,87 
 As a consequence,  1 PC does not rearrange to CHTE, if generated inside  4 . 12,67 Ring -
 expansion cannot compete with the much faster insertion into hemicarcerand bonds. The 
situation is different for  1 PN, in which case intramolecular pathways (intersystem crossing 
and ring - expansion) are much faster than reactions with the hemicarcerand. Thus, pho-
tolysis of incarcerated phenylazide at  − 86  ° C, at which temperature ring - expansion is 
faster than intersystem crossing, produced  4  95 , whose  13 C NMR spectrum could be 
recorded for the ﬁ rst time (Figure  9.31 ).  83a   At this temperature, incarcerated  95 slowly 
decayed within 5 hours to triplet  3 PN by ring - contraction and intersystem crossing, allow-
ing for a precise determination of the activation parameters of this process. If the photoly-
sis was carried out in THF/water 8   :   1,  95 could be trapped with water as lactam  99 .

of  95 . 83b   Under the photolysis conditions,  95  underwent efﬁ cient photochemical electro-
cyclization to the  anti - Bredt imine  100 , which at  − 5  ° C thermally rearranged via a 1,5 -

Reactions Inside Carcerands 
253
 The reactivity and life - time of triplet  3 PN and triplet PC differed remarkably in the 
inner phase of  4 . Whereas PC reacts with  4  already at 15   K and persist probably only a 
few minutes at this temperature,  12,67   the lifetime of incarcerated  3 PN is 13.6  min at  − 3  ° C. 83b 
Both  3 PC and  3 PN preferentially insert into inward pointing acetal C - H bonds of  4 to 
produce  78  and  102 , respectively (Figures  9.24  and  9.31 ). The difference in reactivity 
towards C − H insertion between triplet carbenes and an isoelectronic triplet nitrenes is 
well known and has been explained with a nitrogen rehybridization in the rate limiting 
H - abstraction step of the nitrene. Rehybridization is not needed in the carbene reaction.  61c,86 
 C − H Insertion reactions involving free phenylnitrene are essentially impossible to 
study in solution by laser ﬂ ash photolysis since C − H insertion cannot compete with 
dimerization, which is orders of magnitude faster.  88 Thus, conﬁ ning  3 PN inside the 
molecular container, which eliminates dimerization, provides an elegant way to explore 
this important type of chemistry and allowed for the ﬁ rst time an accurate measurement 
of the activation parameters of a C − H insertion involving  3 PN. 89 
 9.6.8  Norrish Type II Photochemistry 
 Sherman and co - workers recently investigated the photochemistry of butyrophenone  103 
in the inner phase of carcerand  104 (Figure  9.32 ). 90 
 The photochemistry of arylalkylketones is rich and important to organic synthesis.  91 
Photochemical reactions of arylalkylketones typically arise from the triplet  3 ( n ,   π * ) state. 
If a   γ  - hydrogen is present, as for  103 , the excited state abstracts the   γ - hydrogen through 
a cyclic six - membered transition state (Norrish Type II photochemistry). The resulting 
1,4 - biradical disproportionates back to  103 , cyclizes to cyclobutanol  107  (Yang product) 
and/or  β - fragments to ene  106  and enol  105  (Norrish Type II cleavage), which ketonizes 
in solution. The modulation of both photochemical processes through conﬁ nement has 
always been of great interests to supramolecular photochemists. 92 
 Irradiation of  103  inside carcerand  104  gave a 5.6   :   1 mixture of Norrish Type II cleav-
age products  105  and  106  and Yang product  107 , which is very similar to the ratio found 
in solution. On the other hand, incarcerated hexyrophenone was completely stable to 
irradiation even though it shows similar photoreactivity as  103  in solution. The inertness 
of  105  is a result of its inner phase conformation, in which the distance between   γ - protons 
and carbonyl oxygen precludes abstraction. 
 Both Norrish Type II photoproducts remained incarcerated. Furthermore, the surround-
ing host prevented ketonization of  105 , which requires acid or base catalysis. In fact, the 
resistance of incarcerated photoenol to ketonize is remarkable. Incarcerated  105 required

heating to 100  ° C in water - saturated nitrobenzene to yield acetophenone  108 . The extrapo-
lated life time of  15  105  +  106  at room temperature was more than seven orders of 
magnitude higher than that of free  105 . 
 An analysis of the kinetics and product distribution of ketonization in D 2 O saturated 
nitrobenzene gave interesting insight into the mechanism of inner phase ketonization 
(Figure  9.33 ). Ketonization showed biphasic kinetics and is initiated by deprotonation of 
 105 ( I  →  II ). Ion pair  II  either collapses back to  105 ( I ) or forward to acetophenone ( III ). 
 The slow rate of inner phase ketonization is likely a result of a very high energy barrier 
associated with the formation of the ion pair in the hydrophobic and only weekly  ‘ solvat-
ing ’  inner cavity of  104 . The inner phase mechanism is consistent with that proposed by 
Kresge for the uncatalyzed ketonization of free  105 . 93   However, in the inner phase com-
peting proton transfer to the enolate O ( II  →  I ) or C ( II  →  III ) have similar rates, whereas 
the latter step is rate determining in the ketonization of free  105 .Thus, the inner phase 
perturbs the mechanism by substantially raising both barriers and by making them com-
parable in magnitude. 
 9.6.9  Incarcerated Excited States 
 In section  9.3.2 , we have seen that spectral shifts of incarcerated guests can provide insight 
into the electronic and spatial characteristics of the inner phase. Of special interest to the 
photophysical community are also excited state lifetimes of molecules enclosed in con-
strained media.  94   Investigation of these systems may lead to the development of novel 
photophysical probes for immunoassays and devices for information storage or 
solar - energy conversion. Parola  et al . investigated the photophysical properties of 9 - 
cyanoanthracene (CA) inside hemicarcerand  26 (Figures  9.3 and  9.34 ). 95 
 They observed major differences in the photophysical properties of CA upon incarcera-
tion. The surrounding host lead to a red - shift of the absorption spectrum and reduced the

lifetime of the singlet exited state  1 L a  by a factor of 40. In addition, the ﬂ uorescence 
quantum yield was 50 times smaller for incarcerated CA compared to free CA. Since 
guest emission bands and host absorption bands didn ’ t overlap, energy transfer quenching 
from the host to the guest can be ruled out. Parola  et al . concluded that quenching most 
likely takes place by electron transfer from the methoxybenzene units of  26  and that such 
electron transfer would be exothermic. Further studies from this group and independently 
by Farr á n and Deshayes with triplet sensitizer biacetyl incarcerated in  14  and  12 provided 
insight into the role of host and solvent on the lifetime of triplet excited states.  18,96 
Typically, the life - time of triplet excited states depends on the rates of non - radiative 
intersystem crossing (ISC), phosphorescence and of intermolecular quenching via elec-
tron transfer, energy transfer or H - abstraction. In the absence of intermolecular quenching 
processes, the T 1  excited state lifetime of biacetyl increases in the order gas phase, inner 
phase of  14 , liquid phase. This was interpreted with incarcerated biacetyl being in a not 
too tight cavity, which provides more free space with less speciﬁ c cage – guest interactions 
than a solvent cage, but causes still a higher number of excited state – host collisions 
compared to the gas phase. 
 The lifetime of incarcerated biacetyl is unaffected by the solvent as long as it doesn ’ t 
contain heavy atoms. 18 Interestingly, halogenated solvents enhance intersystem crossing 
via a remote external heavy atom effect. This was demonstrated by Romanova  et al . for 
hemicarceplex  12  biacetyl (Figure  9.35 ). 97,98 
 It is well known, that ISC is strongly enhanced in molecules with covalently linked 
atoms of high atomic number (internal heavy atom effect). 99,100 Solvents containing heavy 
atoms, such as halides, also enhance ISC. Such external solvent heavy atom effects are 
believed to require direct contact between chromophore and perturbing molecule.  99,101 
Contrary to this believe, Romanova  et al . measured a pronounced decrease in the phos-
phorescence lifetime of incarcerated triplet biacetyl upon changing the solvent from 
benzene to CH 2 Cl 2  to CHBr 3  to CH 2 I 2 . 97 In CH 2 I 2 , the phosphorescence lifetime was 
7 - fold shorter than in benzene. The shielding of the guest from direct contact with bulk

components shows that long - distance spin – orbit coupling is possible through the walls 
of the hemicarcerand (Figure  9.35 ). This conclusion is further supported by the excellent 
agreement between the measured increase in the ISC rate induced by the external heavy 
atom effect upon switching from CHBr 3  to CH 2 I 2  and that computed based on the current 
theory of ISC induced by intermolecular spin – orbit coupling. 102,103 
 9.6.10  Photoelectron and Triplet Energy Transfer 
 Triplet excited state quenching by photoelectron transfer (PET) and energy transfer (ET) 
play a central role in biological photosynthesis,  104 visual transduction, 105 organic photo-
chemistry, 106   semiconductor photocatalysis and imaging.  107 – 109   PET and ET across the 
insulating walls of a hemicarcerand have recently been studied in order to improve our 
understanding of these photophysical processes. 98

where  FCWDS  are the Franck – Condon weighted density of states and   ν  is the electronic

 The dependence of the rate constant for photoinduced electron transfer k PET  on the 
driving force and reorganization energies is similar. Equation 4 predicts a parabolic 
dependence of log  k ET  on the driving force. At  − ∆ G  =  (  λ s  +   λ v ),  k ET  is largest and decreases 
at smaller (normal region) and more exothermic driving force (inverted region). The 
experimental observation of the Marcus inverted region for electron or energy transfer 
between non - covalently linked triplet excited state/quencher pairs has been very difﬁ cult 
mainly because ET and PET transfer at high driving forces is much faster than the rate 
of diffusional encounter. In the encounter complexes of the hemicarceplex/quencher 
systems (Host  G(T 1 ) … .Q(S 0 ) and Host  G(T 1 ) … .Q) excited state and quencher are 
separated by about 7  Å . As a consequence of a strong distance dependence,  111b,114 ET and 
PET are substantially slower than diffusion, which has made observation of the inverted 
region possible in these systems  96,110,115   In their seminal work on through space triplet ET, 
Deshayes and co - workers studied acetophenone (AC) hemicarceplex  14  Ac and probed 
through - shell triplet ET chemically via the isomerization of  cis - piperylene to  trans - pip-
erylene (Figure  9.36 ). 116

257
 From a Stern – Volmer analysis and the lifetimes of free and incarcerated triplet ace-
tophenone, Deshayes determined a 2.7 - fold slower triplet ET rate for  14  Ac compared 
to free acetophenone. This corresponds to an almost diffusion controlled rate for  14  Ac. 
Since triplet energy is transferred through an electron exchange mechanism, which is 
believed to require a close contact between donor and acceptor, sufﬁ cient overlap of the 
HOMO and LUMO of the donor - acceptor pair through the host - shell must exist. Whether 
the intervening hemicarcerand plays a role in the through - space ET is not clear. As an 
extension of this work, Farr á n and Deshayes studied triplet ET between incarcerated 
biacetyl ( 14  biacetyl) and various bulk phase acceptors.  96   In all cases, hemicarcerand  14 
retarded triplet ET, which suggests a reduced electron - coupling between donor and accep-
tor as a result of their larger separation. Also, log  k ET  and   ∆ G showed a hyperbolic rela-
tionship as predicted by the Golden Rule. 
 Also interesting is the extremely slow triplet ET rate to O 2 , which is typically a highly 
efﬁ cient quencher. Farr á n and Deshayes concluded that when oxygen is prevented from 
coming into direct contact with the donor, the quenching rate drops off drastically. Parola 
 et al . independently measured triplet ET rates from  14  biacetyl to those quenchers used 
by Deshayes and several others and agreed with Deshayes that the difference between  k ET 
of free and incarcerated biacetyl results from different electronic exchange matrix ele-
ments  v . 110   However, they were careful in taking the observed parabolic like relationship 
as ﬁ rm evidence for inverted behavior especially since their data were strongly scattered. 
A parabolic - like correlation may simply reﬂ ect non - homogeneity of the quenchers, as a 
consequence of their different sizes, which leads to different donor - acceptor distances 
and/or orientations and hence to different values for  v . Most likely for the same reason, 
evidence for the inverted region could not be found for quenching of  14  biacetyl by 
electron transfer from bulk phase aromatic amine donors. 
 In a subsequent investigation, Deshayes and Piotrowiak provided clear support for the 
parabolic Marcus relationship and explained the original data by Farr á n and Deshayes 
and Parola  et al . in a quantitative manner by taking into account the different internal 
nuclear reorganization energies   λ v  of the acceptors.  115   According to MO calculations,   λ v 
varies by more than 20  kcal  mol  − 1 among the different acceptors. As a consequence, two 
acceptors with nearly identical driving forces and transfer rates may belong to different 
regions of Marcus parabola. This is the case for dibromoanthracene (DBA) and diphe-
nylbutadiene (DPB) (Figure  9.37 ). Both were assigned to the correct region of a Marcus 
parabola based on their activation energy of transfer, which is negative for the former

(typical for the inverted region), but positive for the latter (normal region behavior). 
Deshayes and Piotrowiak identiﬁ ed four groups of acceptors. (1) Rigid aromatics that 
display small   λ v . (2) Acyclic oleﬁ ns that twist around the double bond upon triplet excita-
tion and therefore have large   λ v . (3) Cyclic oleﬁ ns with even larger   λ v  and (4) O 2 , which 
has essentially no   λ v . Each acceptor group has its own log   k ET  versus   ∆ G correlation 
(Figure  9.37 ). The remaining scattering in the experimental data may result from differ-
ences in size and shape of the acceptors, leading to different effective electronic couplings 
in the corresponding encounter complexes and possibly also to different encounter 
frequencies. 
 The investigation detailed above were mainly concerned with the dependence of triplet 
ET rate on   ∆ G and   λ v  and provided clear support for the inverted region. As pointed out 
earlier, electronic coupling between donor and acceptor is strongly reduced upon separat-
ing them by an intervening hemicarcerand, leading to a slowing of energy and electron 
transfer. In a more recent investigation, Deshayes and Piotrowiak addressed dependence 
of electronic coupling between incarcerated biacetyl and the bulk phase quencher on the 
hemicarcerand size.  20   The electronic coupling between incarcerated biacetyl and the 
acceptor can be described by a simple superexchange mechanism and viewed as a 
sequence of guest – hemicarcerand and hemicarcerand – solute interactions. Thus, the total 
electronic coupling matrix element   ν total  is the product of that for the guest – hemicarcerand 
 ν GH and the hemicarcerand – acceptor interaction   ν HA :

 Hemicarceplexes  4  biacetyl,  15  biacetyl and  14  biacetyl, which vary in size and 
linker characteristics, were included in this study.  k ET  increased with decreasing host size 
in the order k ET ( 4 )  <  k ET ( 14 )  <<  k ET ( 15 ). The average electronic coupling matrix elements 
showed the same trend and are |  ν ( 4 )|  =  0.20 cm  − 1 , |  ν ( 14 )|  =  0.26 cm  − 1 , and |  ν ( 15 )|  =  
0.66 cm  − 1 . Since   ν HA  should be independent of the hemicarcerand size, the differences in 
 ν total reﬂ ect differences in the guest – hemicarcerand electronic couplings   ν HA  among the 
hosts.  ν total was slightly higher for ET to neat acceptors. However, the trends were the 
same and   ν HA  differences measured in neat acceptors were identical to those measured in 
acceptor solutions. These trends are consistent with predictions. The time - averaged guest –
 hemicarcerand interaction should depend on the size of the cavity and should increase 
with decreasing cavity. One can also conclude, that the  o - xylylene linkers in  14 don ’ t 
cause special enhancement of electronic coupling. 
 These investigations not only unraveled the inﬂ uence of the hemicarcerand on the 
mechanism of through - shell triplet ET, but also contribute to the understanding of solvent -
 mediated electron transfer,  117,118   in which a solvent molecule separates donor and acceptor 
and provides the pathway for electronic coupling. Since the thickness of a hemicarcerand 
is comparable to that of common organic solvents, the measured electronic coupling 
matrix elements are good estimates for the magnitude of solvent - mediated contributions 
to electronic coupling in triplet excitation transfer.

cal properties of hemicarceplex  109  azulene immobilized onto the surface of TiO 2 
nanoparticles via its eight peripheral carboxylic groups.  119   Immobilization led to nearly 
complete quenching of the azulene ﬂ uorescence emission, which suggests efﬁ cient ET 
from the excited state to the conducting band of TiO 2 . The time constant for electron 
injection was about 1000 - times slower than that for the 1 - or 2 - carboxyazulene immobi-
lized on TiO 2 . Also, back - electron transfer  109  azulene + /TiO 2  –   →  109  azulene/TiO 2 
was strongly retarded by about the same factor (Figure  9.38 ). Interestingly, the latter 
kinetics could be described with a single exponential in contrast to the 1 - carboxyazulene/
TiO 2  and other dye/TiO 2 systems, 120   for which multi - exponential behavior is observed as 
a consequence of inhomogeneity of binding and presence of surface traps. The homogene-
ous recombination kinetics indicates that tunnelling across the hemicarcerand walls is the 
rate - limiting step of back - electron transfer and that the slow tunneling averages out the 
large distribution of rates that are normally seen. Thus, non - covalent immobilization of 
dye molecules through encapsulation inside a TiO 2  bound hemicarcerand, not only 
increases the lifetime of the charge separated state but also leads to a more homogeneous 
system with respect to the kinetic of charge recombination. It remains to be seen how 
these photophysical properties affect the properties of photovoltaic devices synthesized 
from dye - hemicarceplex/TiO 2 hybrid assemblies. 
 9.7  Conclusions and Outlook 
 This review shows that the inner phase of molecular container compounds are interest-
ing new conﬁ ned environments, in which a large variety of different reactions have 
been carried out and new once have been discovered. Moreover, molecular container 
compounds have become real tools for physical organic chemists to study reaction 
mechanism and long - distance phenomena. Molecular containers made possible the 
investigation of highly strained and reactive molecules under normal working condi-
tions by generating them in the protective inner phase. They also allowed the inves-
tigation of electronic interactions between encapsulated and bulk phase molecules 
through the intervening hemicarcerand and have provided experimental support for 
theoretical models of long distance spin - orbit coupling, electron and energy transfer. 
It is anticipated that this ﬁ eld of research will further grow and that the recent devel-
opment of multi - cavitand nanocapsules 7b,121   will make possible the investigation of 
chemical reactivity of macromolecular guests that are of interest to material and bio-
logical sciences.
