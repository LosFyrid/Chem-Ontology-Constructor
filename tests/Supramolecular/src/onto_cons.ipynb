The past decades have\\nwitnessed progress in supramolecular chemistry that paves\\nthe way to precision (or personalized) medicine. Compared to\\ncovalent approaches, noncovalent ones display several advan-\\ntages, e.g., they avoid tedious syntheses and complicated\\nfriendly as well as time- and cost-effective.[14] Moreover, the\\ndynamic nature of noncovalent interactions allows for the\\nconvenient dissociation and reconstruction of supramolecular\\nmaterials, enabling their recycling and self-healing. Addition-\\nally, the certain adaptability of noncovalent interactions in\\nresponse to external stimuli can be used for the design and\\nfabrication of stimuli-responsive materials.

Overview of Calixarenes\\nIn 1872, Adolph von Bayer reported the first results\\nconcerning products obtained from the reaction of phenol\\nwith formaldehyde.[23] However, he failed to isolate or\\ncharacterize these products after numerous attempts. In\\n1944, Zinke and Ziegler blocked the para-position of\\nphenol by using para-tert-butylphenol and proposed a cyclic\\ntetramer structure for the product of its reaction with\\nformaldehyde.[24] After the 1970s, Gutsche demonstrated the\\npresence of cyclic homologues, in particular the tetramer,\\nhexamer, and octamer, by NMR spectroscopy, showing how\\nthe most common CA macrocycles can be obtained in good\\nyield and with high selectivity under appropriate conditions\\n(base, solvent, temperature, etc.).[25] Besides, Gutsche first\\nproposed the name “calixarenes” by structural analogy with\\nthe form of the ancient Greek calix-krater vases. This name is\\nnow generally used, because the systematic IUPAC terminol-\\nogy is too complicated. The simplified nomenclature of CAs\\nuses [n] to denote the number of phenolic units in the\\nmacrocycle (calix[n]arene, CnA); for example, C4A contains\\nfour units.\\nThe facile derivatization of CAs is one of the key features\\nthat makes them unique among other macrocycles. The\\nhydroxyl groups at the lower rim provide excellent handles\\nfor the incorporation of other moieties via reactions with\\nelectrophiles, as exemplified by O-acylation and O-alkyla-\\ntion.[20] For the upper rim, almost all common substitutions\\npossible for phenols/phenol ethers have been carried out for\\nCAs or their alkyl ether derivatives, e.g., halogenation,\\nnitration, sulfonation, sulfochlorination, and coupling with\\ndiazonium salts.[20] The methylene bridge can be brominated\\nby N-bromosuccinimide to prepare a wide array of methyl-\\nene-modified\\nderivatives.[26]\\nMethylene-bridge-substituted\\nCAs can also be obtained by stepwise synthesis.[27] Further-\\nmore, one can also replace the methylene bridge carbon with\\nother atoms, such as sulfur and oxygen.[28] Control over the\\nnumber and position of introduced substituents allows one to\\nsynthesize a plethora of CA derivatives.[20,21] Moreover,\\nconsidering the tunable scaffold and controllable conforma-\\ntion, one can establish a large molecular library of CA\\nderivatives (Scheme 1) as a material basis for biomedical\\napplications.',\n",

For example, C4A is\\nsuitable for small guests, while C8A is suitable for larger ones.\\nFurthermore, CA recognition behavior is largely dependent\\non decorating groups. For example, the introduction of\\nnegatively charged sulfonate or carboxyl groups provides\\nelectrostatic as well as hydrogen-bonding interaction sites,\\nresulting in strong affinity for cationic guests.[31] In contrast,\\nCAs modified with positively charged guanidinium units\\ntightly bind various organic and inorganic anions.[32] Deep\\ncavitands derived from CAs are capable of encapsulating\\nlarge hydrophobic guests.[22e] In addition, the recognition\\nproperties of CAs are due not only to the presence of cavities,\\nbecause the modification of CA scaffolds with individual\\nligands to afford podand-like structures also plays a significant\\nrole in molecular recognition.[33] Thus, the variability of\\nscaffolds, conformations, and substitution patterns allows\\nCAs to bind a wide range of guests, such as inorganic\\nanions,[34] inorganic cations,[35] organic anions,[36] organic\\ncations,[37] neutral organic molecules,[38] and biological macro-\\nmolecules.[39]\\nIn addition to exhibiting recognition properties, CAs are\\nalso important building blocks for the fabrication of supra-\\nmolecular architectures, such as micelles, vesicles, nanofibers,\\ntubes, capsules, cages, rotaxanes, catenanes, supramolecular\\nAmong\\nthe\\nvarious\\nassemblies,\\nCA-based amphiphiles,\\nwhich can be obtained by simple modification of hydro-\\nphilic/hydrophobic groups on upper/lower rims, are most\\nfrequently engaged in biomedical applications.

For example,\\nmore than 400 CA amphiphiles have been reported.[40b]\\nAdditionally, CAs can form supra-amphiphiles via CAinduced aggregation.[22d,40a,43] Hydrophilic CAs can promote\\nthe self-aggregation of aromatic or amphiphilic molecules by\\nlowering their critical aggregation concentration (CAC),\\nenhancing aggregate stability and compactness, and regulating the degree of order in aggregates.[44] The fascinating\\nassembly behavior, along with the aforementioned recognition properties, especially for biological substrates, provides\\nsupramolecular approaches to realizing biomedical applications of CAs.',\n",

Summary and Outlook\\nIn summary, CAs have been widely applied in biomed-\\nicine, e.g., for biosensing and bioimaging, contributing to in\\nvivo and in vitro diagnosis.[172] Moreover, CAs have been used\\nto construct drug and gene delivery systems, which contrib-\\nuted to targeted therapy. Additionally, the antibacterial,\\nantiviral, anticancer, detoxification, and amyloid fibrillation\\ninhibition activities of CAs promote the development of\\nmacrocyclic therapeutics. Such abundant biomedical applica-\\ntions benefit from the rich (supramolecular) chemistry of CAs\\nand their broad chemical design space attributable to the ease\\nof CA modification. The supramolecular chemistry of CAs\\npaves the way to the exploration of biomedical functions. CAs\\nhave unique recognition properties, as their cavity can not\\nonly specifically recognize guests, but also quench the\\nfluorescence and photoactivity of several dyes, which makes\\nCAs suitable for turn-on fluorescence sensing, imaging, and\\nactivatable PDT. The CA skeleton can also be applied as\\na podand-like ligand for constructing novel recognition\\nsystems. CAs also possess excellent assembly properties. For\\nexample, because of their pre-organized framework, CA\\namphiphiles can form more stable and compact assemblies\\nthan the corresponding monomers. Therefore, amphiphilic\\nCA-based drug/gene delivery systems often exhibit better\\nperformances than polymer-based ones. However, in contrast\\nto polymers, CA amphiphiles have more defined molecular\\nstructures with precise size and molecular weights, which\\nensures batch-to-batch consistency and is an advantage for\\nclinical translation and regulatory approval. Notably, the CA\\ncavity size can be adjusted by changing the number of\\nphenolic units and can be adapted to different functions. For\\nexample, the optimal cavity size of C5A allows it to selectively\\nand strongly bind LPA, which cannot be achieved by either\\nsmaller or larger analogues.[80] CAs also exhibit the benefit of\\nconformation controllability (and hence, control of physico-\\nchemical properties and biomedical functions). For example,\\nguanidinium-modified C4A in cone conformation exhibits the\\nhighest DNA transfection efficiency, as it has a more suitable\\nlipophilicity than C4As in 1,3-alternate and mobile confor-\\nmations.[128a] These intrinsic features, including ease of\\nmodification, selective and strong binding to biological\\nsubstrates, stable and compact assembly, tunable scaffold,\\nand controllable conformation, collectively make CAs a priv-\\nileged\\nplatform\\nfor\\ndiverse\\nbiomedical\\napplications',\n",
