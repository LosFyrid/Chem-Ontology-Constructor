       " {'content': '1. INTRODUCTION\\nIn the past decades, molecular recognition using macrocyclic\\nreceptors has attracted considerable interest in supramolecular\\nchemistry.5 Synthetic macrocycles aim to mimic the remarkable\\nproperties exhibited by biological receptors.6,7 They are\\nsynthesized by combining aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic\\ncomponents. Some macrocycles possess internal cavities capable\\nof surrounding the surface of the bound guest. Macrocyclic\\nreceptors have been used to investigate noncovalent interactions\\nin solution.8 They have also found applications in molecular\\nsensing,9 liquid−liquid extraction,10 transmembrane trans-\\nport,11 reactivity modulation,12 and catalysis,13 among\\nothers.14,15\\nMany macrocyclic receptors, i.e., calix[4]arene, resorcin[4]-\\narene, pillar[4]arene, cucurbit[n]uril, etc., feature aromatic\\ncavities not functionalized with converging polar groups, which\\nlimits their use in binding processes exclusively relying on size\\nand shape complementarity. High-affinity and selective binding\\nof charged and neutral polar guests demands equipping the\\nreceptor’s cavity with complementary functional/polar groups.\\nNevertheless, the synthesis of receptors possessing function-\\nalized aromatic/hydrophobic cavities represents a challenging\\nendeavor.16,17 We and others used calix[4]pyrrole (C[4]P)\\nscaffolds to address the issue of functional complementarity for\\nthe binding of polar substrates.\\npreferentially adopts 1,2- and 1,3-alternate conformations. The\\naddition of a coordinating anion induces the switching of 1 into\\nthe cone conformation owing to the establishment of four\\nIn addition, and mainly in nonpolar chlorinated solvents, 1 acts\\nas ion-pair receptor in the complexation of cesium, imidazolium\\nand alkylammonium salts of coordinating anions.

This cavity is\\nopposite to the bound anion, and the included cation\\nexperiences favorable Coulombic, cation−π and CH−π\\ninteractions. This binding geometry is referred as receptor-\\nment of a methyl group in each one of the meso-carbons of 1\\nafforded “four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps (Figure 1d).25,26 The synthesis\\nof “two-wall” AE-C[4]Ps involves two acid-mediated con-\\ndensation reactions. First, the condensation of a methyl aryl\\nketone with pyrrole, used as solvent, affords a dipyrromethane.\\nSecond, the cyclocondensation of the obtained dipyrromethane\\nwith acetone, also used as solvent, gives the “two-wall” AE-C[4]\\nP as a mixture of two configurational isomers: αβ and αα,\\ndepending on the relative orientation of the two meso-aryl\\n\\x0csubstituents. For the same token, the direct acid-mediated\\ncyclocondensation reaction of a methyl aryl ketone with pyrrole,\\nin an organic solvent, produces crudes of “four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps\\ncontaining up to four isomers: αβαβ, ααββ, αααβ, and αααα\\n(or tetra-α). On the one hand, the cone conformation of the\\n“four-wall” tetra-α isomer displays a deep aromatic cavity open\\nat one end and equipped with a polar binding site at the closed\\n20% yield in the cyclocondensation reaction, with some\\nexceptions (e.g., >35% yield when using either meta- or para-\\nhydroxyphenyl methyl ketones).25,27 On the other hand, the\\ncone conformation of the “two-wall” αα-isomer, which is usually\\nproduced in 5−30% yield upon the cyclocondensation step,\\nIn both cases, the polar binding site is defined by four converging\\npyrrole NHs. The aromatic cavities/clefts of AE-C[4]Ps can be\\nfurther elaborated by placing substituents at their upper rims.1−3\\nIn addition, the meso-carbons of AE-C[4]Ps can bear alkyl\\nsubstituents instead of methyl groups. For example, the\\ncyclocondensation reaction to give “four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps\\nbearing meso-alkyl substituents with terminal functional groups\\noften fails or produces the tetra-α isomer in low yield (ca. 1%).28\\nNevertheless, the use of methyltrialkylammonium chloride salts\\nas templates enhances the macrocyclization reaction and favors\\nthe formation of the tetra-α isomer (up to 62% yield).29 It is\\nworth mentioning that the reaction conditions of the cyclo-\\ncondensation in “two-wall” and “four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps lack of\\ngenerality. They are dependent on the alkyl aryl ketone, acid and\\nsolvent used. Moreover, the macrocyclization reaction might\\nsuffer, in some cases, from low reproducibility.30,31\\nOver the last 15 years, our research group focused on the\\ndesign and synthesis of AE-C[4]P receptors for the selective and\\nefficient binding of anions, ion-pairs, and neutral polar\\nmolecules. In this Account, we discuss the binding properties\\nof “two-wall” and “four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps and their derivatives,\\nsuch as AE-C[4]P cavitands and super aryl-extended C[4]Ps\\n(SAE-C[4]Ps).32 We also describe their applications in\\nmolecular sensing, facilitated transmembrane transport, and\\nmodulation of chemical reactivity. Moreover, we demonstrate\\ntheir use as model systems for the quantification of noncovalent\\ninteractions. Finally, we describe selected examples of bis-C[4]P\\nreceptors based on covalent and self-assembled structures',\n",

       " {'content': '9. Conclusion\\nWe reviewed our own results on the supramolecular chemistry\\nof AE-C[4]Ps and their derivatives. In solution, C[4]Ps were\\nshown to bind anions, ion-pairs, and neutral polar molecules.\\nThe binding studies of halides with “two-wall” and “four-wall”\\nAE-C[4]Ps provided experimental energy values for gauging\\nanion−π interactions. The elaboration of the aromatic cavity of\\n“four-wall” AE-C[4]Ps afforded AE-C[4]P cavitands and SAE-\\nC[4]Ps. AE-C[4]Ps acted as carriers in the facilitated trans-\\nmembrane transport of anions (“two-wall” AE-C[4]Ps) but also\\nof amino acids (cavitands). Monophosphonate cavitands were\\nalso employed for the recognition and sensing of creatinine. The\\nplacement of ionizable or charged groups at the periphery of\\n“four-wall” AE- and SAE-C[4]Ps enabled to study molecular\\nrecognition processes in water. Water-soluble SAE-C[4]Ps were\\nused for the quantification of the HE and the monofunction-\\nalization reaction of bis-isonitriles. The upper rim elaboration of\\nAE- and SAE-C[4]Ps enabled the covalent construction of bis-\\nC[4]Ps and the self-assembly of dimeric capsules and\\nunimolecular metallo-cages.\\n(CCDC-1876528) and (b) 23a⊂[28a·Pd]2+ (CCDC-1876529).\\nEnergy-minimized structures of (c) [(CH3CN)(29)]⊂[28a·Pd]2+\\nand (d) simplified cis,cis-30⊂[28b·Pd]6+.\\n\\x0cOther authors implemented C[4]Ps in supramolecular14 and\\ncovalent65,66 polymeric materials (anion capture) and in\\ntherapeutics (potential anticancer drugs).15 In addition, “two-\\nwall” AE-C[4]Ps and cavit and derivatives described here might\\nfind potential applications as therapeutic tools owing to their\\ntransmembrane transport properties. Moreover, the functional-\\nization of surfaces with AE-C[4]P derivatives might lead to the\\ndevelopment of sensors. However, the practical applications of\\nAE- and SAE-C[4]Ps require increasing the yields of the\\nmacrocyclization reactions affording the AE-C[4]P scaffolds.\\nWe hope that this Account will inspire researchers to develop\\nnew constructs based on C[4]Ps and apply them in other\\ncomplementary areas, such as supramolecular catalysis, chemical\\nbiology, and materials science.\\npostdoctoral fellow with Prof. Julius Rebek, Jr., at the University of\\nPittsburgh and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and\\nwith Prof. José M.
